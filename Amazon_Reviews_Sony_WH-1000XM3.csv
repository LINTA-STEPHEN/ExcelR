Better than ATH M50x, Sennheiser HD598 in noisy environments!",5.0,"I have Audio Technica ATH M50x and Sennheiser HD598 headphones that I've been using for the past 4 years. I also have Yamaha HS5 studio monitors. These are the baseline of comparison for me. I'd never wanted to buy another headphones for myself as I was already set with the two headphones (1 open back and 1 closed back) and a pair of excellent near field studio monitors for my recording deck. But one day my brother got these and was listening to them. I casually tried them on and was blown away by the noise cancellation prowess of these pair. And also was thoroughly impressed by the freedom wireless headphones offered. I was always of the opinion that wired headphone's sound quality could never be matched by a wireless headphones. It's true but these come pretty damn close!Things I absolutely love about the headphones are;1. Noise Cancellation is wonderful!. Whatever happens around you is barely audible as soon as you put these on. It may be weird at first but you get used to the active noise cancellation. And once the music starts playing, you're completely isolated in your own world. Nothing comes through once you put these on. I just totally love that about these headphones.2. Sound Quality: Now this is subjective. There are certain aspects of sound that I like in each of my headphones. On my M50x I like the analytical sound and I like that I can pick up anything and everything. But it gets a little too shrill and piercing because it's treble is too powerful and can be very very fatiguing. As for my HD598, being open back, they have good sound stage and they have the sennheiser veil. They are warm and almost flat. For laid back music listening they are wonderful and you can listen to them for 8 to 10 hours without any discomfort!. As for these, they are the best of both the worlds. The highs are clear and you can pick out the details in all the songs. The bass is wonderfully tight and strong. I've not seen such bass either in M50x or HD598. And I just love it. Even though I prefer the flat sound signature of HD598, I still like the slightly accentuated bass in these cans.3. The convenience: This was what pushed me to purchase. I can't believe how angry I got when every manufacturer in the world started removing the 3.5 mm Headphone jack. I wowed to never buy phones without headphone jack and also mentally became judgmental about wireless headphones. But after seeing my brother's Sony WH-1000XM3s I understood what I was missing out on. It's the convenience.... Not the sound quality or comfort or anything else that gets to you. I now use the headphones more often. So, essentially I'm getting more out of the money I spent on these. (And these are not cheap!). Battery life seems to be as advertised. I used these cans for almost 10 hours straight for the first 3 days and then had to charge them. These charge up in about half hour. Very nice feature.What I dislike....1. Comfort: I have large ears. Even though the cups are large enough that my big ears fit in them, they are not deep enough. After about an hour my ears start getting pinched and I have to adjust them or remove them for 1 or 2 minutes. Curiously enough, this only happens on the right earcup. Either my right earlobe is disproportionately large or the headphone cup is heavier on right side because of battery, because I've noticed that when you charge the headphones, the right earcup heats up. So either the charging circuit is there or the battery is. Whatever it might be, comfort is not as good as the sennheiser. I wouldn't even compare these with M50x on comfort because M50x suck at comfort! These are far better than M50x in comfort and a little worse than sennheiser HD598.2. Mids: As mentioned previously, I like flat sound signature, and these cans have recessed mids. The voices and instruments in the vocal range (like woodwinds) sound muted on these cans. Whereas on Sennheiser HD598 they are crystal clear. Perhaps my ears need to get used to the sound signature or have become accoustomed to flat sounding headphones. Whatever the case might be, mids are lower than bass and treble sounds in these cans. This doesn't take away from the musicality of the headphones though. The tracks sound wonderfully nice on these. You just need to turn up the volume to hear the voices (which in turn makes the instruments louder as well!) The male voices get muted a little. but female voices sound alright.In terms of sound quality considering my tastesSony WH-1000XM3 --- 8.8/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 9.6/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 9.4/10Yamaha HS5 --- 9.8/10 (you can hear everything in these :-)ComfortSony WH-1000XM3 --- 8.5/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 9/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 6/10Yamaha HS5 --- 10/10 (you don't need to wear them)Portability/Convenience. This should be your deciding factor to buy them or not.Sony WH-1000XM3 --- 10/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 7/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 7/10Yamaha HS5 --- 0/10 (these weigh 20 kgs and need wires and a sound card to run)Other considerations1. Call quality is decent over the phone but doesn't do well with Whatsapp video call or google hangouts or Cisco Webex (Yes I used these for meetings just to see how good the microphones were. It turns out that direct calls are fine but anything else and they fall apart).2. Controls: They are a little finicky. I'd have liked physical buttons that have a certainty to them. Here you're sometimes not sure if your action has been registered. Also when your fingers are sweaty, they don't slide as easily as you'd like them to. This causes noise due to finger dragging with friction over the control surface.Overall, I'd recommend this to everyone who wants to isolate themselves from the outside world. These are very good at that. But for pure sound quality or absolute comfort, I'd still recommend wired headphones like Sennheiser HD598. The problem with wireless headphones is that the technology (bluetooth) is still advancing and it might be 5 more years until it catches up to the quality of wired headphones. Then wireless headphones will fully take over the wired headphones market because only in sound quality department wireless headphones are lacking right now. The technology of wired headphones has come to its peak. There's nothing more to be done in that. The future is indeed wireless headphones with active noise cancellation. There's a lot to be done in this aspect. These technologies are still nascent. There's lot of scope of improvement in terms of pairing ease, bandwidth of bluetooth connection, battery life and noise cancellation algorithms.These are for people who travel a lot and need sound isolation to enjoy music. These are for people who like convenience over absolute sound quality. Bluetooth technology hasn't yet caught up with the wired headphone sound quality. But it will soon. These headphones are almost there.I wrote this review because no one has been comparing wireless headphones with wired ones. I hope it helps someone who is deciding to get a new phone that doesn't have a headphone jack. If you value absolute sound quality, don't get a phone without headphone jack. The wired headphones still offer better value and sound quality but at the expense of convenience."

Beats the competition",5.0,"Before I start with the review, let me make it clear that my tryst with noise cancellation headphones began in 2012 with the humble yet impressive Nokia BH-905 which I purchased for around 300 USD. My desire for good headphones started in the year 2008 with the wired Bose headphones and another Bose headphone a few years later. I am the proud owner of the Sennheiser PXC 550 for the past 3 years and have used it extensively to the extent that the leatherette coating has worn out beyond salvation.Although I do not claim myself to be an audiophile, I will do my best to review the Sony WH-1000XM3 to the best of my ability. This review will also compare the 1000 XM3 to the PXC 550.Packaging :-------------The headphones arrived in a decent box. The build quality of the box could be improved. The PXC 550 were packed in a much better built box. The product is made in Malaysia.Carrying case :-----------------The carrying case, although hard, is of average quality. The PXC 550 has a softer case in comparison. None of them come even closer to the immaculate carrying case which was provided with the Nokia BH-905 in 2012 !!!Build quality :----------------The 1000XM3 is pretty robust. I did not find much difference when compared to PXC 550. The main difference is that the earcups have a free sideways movement and no hard clicks. There could be confusion as to which one is left ear and which one is right. It will take some time to make peace with the fact that the left earcup has an NFC symbol on it.Ergonomics :---------------While I was used to the PXC 550 with all the buttons on its right side, the 1000 XM3 is in sharp contrast with the buttons on its left side. There is a multifunction button and a power button. The touch pad is located on the right side. There is a USB C charging port on the right side ( the updated PXC 550 still has a micro usb port )The head band is of decent quality and I did not face any trouble wearing the headphones.The earcups when compared to the PXC 550 are a tad uncomfortable to wear. While it is a known fact that around ear noise cancellation headphones will make your ears sweat after say, 2 hours of usage, I felt more comfortable with the PXC 550. Also the 1000 XM3 has an additional cushioning in front of the sound driver which is bound to  touch the ear pinna and cause you some irritation until such time that you get used to wearing the headphones.The headphones will definitely make your ears sweat. Period.So don't buy these headphones (or any around ear noise cancellation headphones for that matter ) to complain that the ears sweat !!!Noise cancellation :----------------------The 1000XM3 beats the competition upfront when it comes to noise cancellation. There is a feature to calibrate the noise cancellation and optimize it as per the situation, The multifunction button toggles between normal mode, ambience mode and noise cancellation mode. There is a feature where the noise cancellation levels can be adjusted for sitting, walking, running and transport. If ambient sound control is switched on, this feature will automatically adjust the noise cancellation levels as set by the user.Those who keep complaining about some ear pressure, please note that this is the basis on which noise cancellation works and hence there is bound to be some discomfort when noise cancellation is active. Take this from a person who has been regularly using noise cancelling headphones for the past 8 years.Sound quality :-----------------I never bothered to ponder over the sound quality when using the PXC 550 as I trusted a 30k headphone to sound well. But when I got my hands on the 1000 XM3, I did an upfront comparison between the two and I found out that the 1000 XM3 definitely sound better (by a small margin) than the PXC 550. Some rogue reviews mentioned that Sony has more bass than the others. I disagree with this statement. The 1000 XM3 has a punchier sound than the PXC 550 and hence one gets a feeling of more bass in comparison. On a lighter note, there is an option to increase bass levels using the software if the headphones aren't doing enough already !!!Connectivity :----------------Found no issues with connectivity. When compared to the PXC 550, the Bluetooth signal was just about the same strength, although the PXC 550 are a bit better. I tried out the headphones with a windows 10 laptop as well and found no issues. The headphones worked fine with my iPad air.The wired connection worked without any issues.The NFC function also worked fine.Touchpad :-------------The touch pad does a pretty decent job. But when I compare to the PXC 550, I felt that the 1000 XM3 has a slower response although it should not be much of a bother.On a positive note, there is a feature of lowering the music volume by just touching the touchpad with the palm. This feature is very useful when you want to listen to somebody without removing the headphones.Battery life :--------------The claimed battery life is 30 hours under test conditions. I did not bother to break my head over the number of hours I got with a single charge.Software :------------This is one factor where the 1000 XM3 outperform the PXC 550 by a big margin. The Sennheiser software was just a gimmick where the user could not do much than check the battery level of the headphones and a few other settings. The Sony software is very detailed with numerous settings and you can really control your headphones using the software. The headphone firmware was updated when I first connected them using the software. Beware that the update takes around 45 minutes to complete and you need to be patient.Conclusion :--------------For 19.3k during the Prime day sale, I am more than happy with these headphones. I did have an option to buy the updated PXC 550 or the Bose QC 35, but I chose to go ahead with Sony.One common issue with any premium headphone is the availability of replacement ear cushions and I still haven't been able to get one for my PXC 550. It is relatively easier to get one for the QC 35 and I hope that I don't have to beat around the bush much to get a replacement cushion for the 1000 XM3 in the near future."

Expensive but the way to go! my FIRST Noise Cancellation Headphones!",5.0,"This is my FIRST Noise Cancellation Headphones! So NOT AN Expert opinion :P-) Noise Cancellation is like using a tight In-Ear headphones But this is more comfortable-) This will block external noise like AC, FAN, Rain etc. Block means not 100% but 80 to 90%!-) If you play music! You will not hear anything from outside world! (As I said an In-Ear headphones do the same but it will be slightly painful)-) A tight In-Ear headphones are not a replacement for Built in Noise Cancellation! I just point it out to the people who never experienced a Noise Cancellation headphones in life. This Noise Cancellation is Another level. You will only believe it when you actually get a chance to use it. NO YouTube reviews will give you the real experience.This Noise Cancellation Headphones is useful WHEN- I watch youtube videos / tutorials- I write code- I brainstorming- I travel- I go to bed and hear some songs before sleep- I need to disconnect from the annoying world! around me :)Battery life is really good. USB-C means one less cable, Fast charging is good!, Touch control is awesome, if you put right hand to right ear cup you can come back to the world you are in. it is a huge plus, when mom are dad call me! all I need to do is put my hand on the right ear cup!Overall this NC Headphone Improved my life! Here is how.- Now I can focus more on my work- Less distraction from external noise (It is not 100% But 99% of the time it is 100%)- I hate travelling because of the the sounds and noise will influence my thoughts, I actually waste my time while travel because of that. yes a good In-Ear earphone can help but this is another level. So now I can actually do my stuff in my own world using this Noise Cancellation Headphones!Value?Yes -- if you have 30K to throw away. And it will not hurt your life in any way.No -- if you need to save money for next 12 Months to get this.Sound Quality?Base is there! If you are looking for that.But the nice thing is Sony's EQ can Adapt! That means anyone can change the Sound Aspects according to there needs from the Application. Out of the box it is perfect for my taste!If someone like less base you can change that through EQ.No product is perfect so in this Model what to improve?- Only once device can be connected at a time. (Minimum 2 devices is required now a days! [eg Laptop and SmartPhone])- User replaceable ear cup cushions!- Call Quality. This Headphones have an array of microphones but when when we call someone they will hear all Background Noise. I used it for some VOIP calls, It is usable but built in Microphones on your phone will do a much better job.- More and improved NC! Yes why not. There is always room for improvements.^^ I really don't know what to write as cons.I will Update this after using this for a week or two. bye.﻿"

Unique and awesome but can be improved!",5.0,"Reached before 12pm today on 19th. Awesome delivery service by Amazon and Appario retail.My first NC headphone and in fact  my first over the ear headphone .  Wanted a headphone with ANC so that i can hear good music even at very low volumes. This does achieve that to a large extent.Sound quality and isolation is good even without ANC turned on. What's really commendable is that the audio with the 3.5mm wired connection in the passive mode (i.e with the headphone switched off) was also quiet decent. Do note that with the wired connection you can still switch on the phone and  enable the ANC  but the app however  remains disabled .App works only when the Bluetooth is active .Found some issues  with the app. Since app is just a softwareI hope it would be updated soon  so not reducing any star . When we try to change mode from ""priority on sound quality"" to ""priority on stable connection"" and vice versa then the music stops and doesn't restart. If you want any equaliser changes these are possible only with ""priority on stable connection"". Further many times the app just forgets your last settings of Equalizer or surround sounds and just defaults to native options. Overall the app just doesn't appear premium like the headphones and is buggy. Seems the app development team was taking a nap while the hardware team was burning the midnight night oil. Comfort is good .Don't have any benchmark of BOSE so can't compare. Even tried to lie down with the headphones . Possible  if you use a pillow and want to lie sidewise. You cannot do it on regular basis but the intention was to try to see if it's possible occasionally. So I hope it should help in train journeys for masking loud snores of fellow passengers , khat-khat sound of train and getting good sleep.  When trying to do this test in my home I actually fell asleep :). The can fits into the pocket b/w pillow and the shoulder. Of course it's not a perfect fit ( like  you are not wearing your headphones at all )  but still it was possible by adjusting yourself.The touch controls do tend to get accidentally touched in this case,  say by your biceps or elbow . I hope in future updates Sony gets an option to disable/enable the touch, say by pressing both the power and the ANC button for some time.Touch controls do sometime tend to disobey you but still not a very big issue. The touch control  also responded when I tried to use a thick cloth but somehow  very not predictable.  Tried this to emulate the gloves in winters.The pad foam  do tend to get a little sweaty after around 2hrs and had to take the phones off for a few minutes . Currently the temperature is around 28deg. The phone pad foams should work very well for winters but it appears that in suumers they would tend to get warm and sweaty in case worn for long time. No comparison with Bose so can't compare relatively.ANC is good but for the first time users it does tend to create a in cabin pressure feeling. I however got accustomed to it in few hours. Thankfully there is an option to control the level of ANC.One thing I would like to mention about ANC . I tried testing the ANC with a 1500w mixer grinder and a 2000w vacuum cleaner as well. Don't assume it would mask the sound totally. I could still hear the whine if the motor very well. If you clap your hand you can still hear a thud  but all these sounds with the music on would be muted by 70-80 percent and  won't disturb you. This is just to align your expectations of the ANC. But ANC is still awesome and it would take some time to realise how awesome it is .  I was hearing coldplay at very low volumes with and without ANC , with the water tap on at full speed  ; the difference was phenomenal. And if you like cranked up volumes then of course the ANC would be even more effective.Battery is very good . Even after 3 hours of mixed  listening  on Bluetooth it was showing as 100percent. Sound quality is good and you can customise the equaliser for two of your own choices also . Bass can be tuned very well. I wish the settings got saved in the headphone rather than in the app.The music doesn't stop if you remove your headphones. Thats strange since this feature is present even in lower models like plantronics backbeat pro available,  at 11k.Regarding call quality,  I switched on the vaccum cleaner and made a call to the other party. They never complained about not hearing me. What I have found is that , unlike in some web  reviews, when making calls the ANC does remain active and the ambient noise doesn't  reach your ears or the other  person. May be the software has been tweaked since those reviews.  However it does appear as if you are talking with your ears covered by hand.  So you have  get to get used to that feeling . Overall found the call quality to be decent .If you have a balding head like me the phones tend to slip a bit :( which is just physics  . But hairy heads won't have this issue.Nevertheless I am enjoying it :)"

Recommended For Noise Cancellation",4.0,"I was a bit skeptical about buying this after reading about the static noise issues with either cups. The new version, XM4 were also revealed and available for pre-order elsewhere, and the reviews were very positive.Decided to buy these because:1. XM3 was available on sale and pricing was on par with sale prices in other parts of the world - and I could get it with Indian warranty (thought I need it after reading about the noise issues).2. XM3 is still quite good at noise cancellation when compared to XM4. XM4 would be probably launched in India around festive season (Sept-Nov) and would probably cost ~27k during sale. I didn't think I would need the improvements compared to what I save in price (9k). One would get improved sound quality due to the up-scaling chip, slightly better noise isolation, slightly more comfortable with the updated pads, play-pause music when headphone is worn-taken out, much improved mic (5 mic setup with ability to cancel cut some ambient sound) and finally support for multi-point connections (pair phone and laptop together and switch seamlessly).3. If I waited for XM4 prices to drop, rumors of XM5 with maybe a newer design will prompt one to wait even further. This is not going to end.So got these, tried them on for more than a week and here is what I think:1. If you don't need noise cancellation, then these aren't great value for the price. But if you need it, then you are looking at the one of the best. Cancels out most of the ambient sound (except voice - which you still can hear as muffled sounds - which can be masked by increasing volume a bit).2. Coming from wired headphones, these do feel heavy (these are one of the lightest noise cancelling headphones, so I wonder how comfortable the others are). But one does get used to it after a while.3. If you have never used a noise cancelling headphone in the past, ask around or visit a store to try this on. One may not like the feeling of wearing it, I for one didn't like it at all but then this is something you have to get used to when you are looking at noise cancellation. I think Bose is still more comfortable to wear.4. The bundled USB C cable is a jock. If you don't have a longer USB C cable, get one. You can use most chargers which lets you plug in a cable. Also comes with an airline adapter, good carrying case and an aux 3.5mm cable to use this wired (when battery is dead - without noise cancelling).5. Got a 1-2 months old import, made in Malaysia. So quite new, wonder why they were still making these (rumors of XM4 have been floating around for a long time, so I would have expected them to stop production).6. It supports lot of Codecs, so you don't have to worry about latency. But don't expect to game on this (connected to PC/PS4 via supplied cable), sounds quite weird with the bass rich sound profile (maybe I have to play with some setting to get it right).7. Sound quality is great for a Bluetooth headphone, but don't expect miracles if you have used decent wired or Bluetooth headphones. Much cheaper Bluetooth headphones can give you the same quality - but not coupled with similar noise isolation.8. The ear pads and padding in headband are comfortable. They are memory foam wrapped in synthetic leather. Downside is that they will get flaky after quite some time (even if you take good care of it, leave in a non-humid area). The manual has listed ear-pads as a replacement part available via authorized service center. I'm counting on that, if not, I'm sure parts will still be available from some part of the world since these sold quite well."

Sony service is the worst in the world. I have never come across such poor quality of service.",1.0,"The ProblemIt was about a few months ago that I started noticing a creaky noise from the right side of my WH-1000XM3 while listening to some audiobooks during a walk. At first, I ignored the noise as I thought it is due to my adjustments of the headband.I tried everything from removing my glasses to trying the tightest fit to get rid of the noise. To my disappointment, none of it worked.Visiting the service centre [4th July'20]I called in sony customer care who provided me with the phone no. of service centre near me. I reached out to ""iconnect"" in Gurgaon and tried describing my problem to him to which the response was that there is no need to explain to me the problem, just drive down to the service station. Surprised by the utter rudeness of attendant.I still followed the instructions and drove down to the service centre before 5 pm ( as I was instructed).I drove around 15 km to ""iconnect"" sony authorised service centre in Gurgaon. I patiently waited for my turn in an extremely warm service centre( The AC did not function). Interaction with the service centre employeeI started to describe the issue to an unengaged attendant who was still looking at his laptop screen.Me: I have been hearing squeaky noises from the right hinge of my headphones.He: ""Quiky"" without raising his head and continuing to look into his laptop.( As if the word was funny to him)Me: Excuse me!He: Yes, Sir.Me: The right side hinge makes noises even when the headphones are turned off. It is a workmanship defect.He: I haven't heard of such an issue ever.Me: But, it is an issue with my pair of headphones.He: We haven't been informed by Sony of any such issue.Meanwhile, my father started to record this interaction.To which the employee reacted aggressively that you can't record this. ( In an agitated tone)He said I won't serve you if you keep recording and left his counter.My father yielded and put his phone back into his pocket as we drove aa long way, the headphones were expensive and were going out of warranty in a few weeks.Finally, things moved forward, the service centre employee asked one of the technicians to look into the matter. We waited for another 40 mins. Meanwhile, the negative thoughts of getting my headphones messed up and with further damage crossed my mind as this place did not seem or operated professionally The Technician arrives with his analysis.The Technician: I have checked the circuitry and problem is not stemming from the electricals but is of mechanical in nature. I facepalmed myself and said to myself ""Exactly what I described, Why did you open my headphones""Next steps. The attendant spoke to a Sony employee and described him the problem over the phone & finally created a job sheet saying with the problem described as "" Abnormal noise from the right hinge even when the device is switched off""I asked him, what are the next steps, he said that he would let me know my Tuesday i.e 7th July'20 after he sends a video of this issue to the Sony Official. ( I am not too sure is the sound could be captured in a video effectively)Current status: I am patiently waiting for any update with the fear that I would be returned my old headphones which have now been open by not so professional service centre and might be prone to malfunction and since the warranty is near its end I might have to live with a product is further messed by the service centre.Update: 7th July 20The day I was promised that I would get to know what is the status of my service request.3 Sony call centre calls - Have committed me they have forwarded my concern to the service centre.5 calls to the service station- Either the some of the phones provided are always busy or out of service.I have no idea what is the status of my service request.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After calling the service centre for the 10th time they have finally replied that the headphones have been repaired and I can collect it. Which was informed to be non - repairable defect at the day of the first visit.The situation has gone bad to worse. Kindly help. I feel that I have been ripped off of my money by making this purchase decision. My request to SonyI have been a Sony customer & Fan for long, I remember our First coloured TV was a made in Japan Sony TV, which was a matter of pride for the entire family, Second was the iconic Walkman, then the flat screen Sony Wega ( I remember being mesmerised by picture quality I saw at the store), Sony Xperia U, Sony SRS-ZR7 and the latest WH-1000XM3.I believe the quality of service is the weakest link for Sony in India and this experience would deter me to move ahead or recommend Sony products to my friends and family with confidence. Kindly take this feedback and reflect on what kind of feelings do you want to invoke when a person hears the name ""Sony"". Should it invoke the feeling confidence & high quality that arises from its Japanese origins or the brand with terrible service?Buyer Beware."

Simply Astounding - Exceeds Expectations",5.0,"Prior to purchasing this product, I was a tad skeptical as I did not want to pay almost 30K for a pair of headphones.However, on further research and after reading many reviews, I decided to go for it, and after finally getting it, I am convinced that it's worth it. Let me tell you why...I purchased the silver one - purely for aesthetic reasons.. it looks great when compared to the black one, which in my opinion is just too plain. Truth be told, it is not exactly silver, more of a mixture between cream white and grey.The headphones are made out of a very good quality plastic, the inner structure is metal, and the headphone earcups are made of a very soft and comfortable leather.I would recommend wiping off any sweat or perspiration that accumulates on the leather earcups because pure leather starts flaking over time when exposed to moisture, but it's nothing to worry about too much.Comfort - 10/10 - There are many reviews which say that the fit is tight and that it makes the ears sweat. This is not entirely true, which these headphones have a slightly tighter fit as compared to the Bose QC 35s, it is not uncomfortable at all. I found it a lot more comfortable in comparison to many other headphones I have used in the past.It's slight tightness is for a very good reason  - to seal the sound in. If you take the Bose QC35s, they have a looser fit and are more comfortable, but the sound bleeds very badly, and is often embarrassing because it would disturb people sitting around you, this is not a problem with the Sonys as the sound would not bleed unless you use it at the highest volume and even then, just a little sound can be heard by others.The leather earcups are extremely comfortable as well on ear, and their quality is just plush and pristine.Noise Cancellation - 10/10 - The noise cancellation on these headphones are supposed to be the #1 industry standard out there, and this is justified, because after testing it out, it does block out almost 80% of all surrounding ambient noise.This is leagues ahead of the Bose QC35 noise cancellation. The Bose's noise cancellation has a cabin pressure like feel, it gets uncomfortable after a while and gives you a mild headache and sometimes makes your ears pop - just like when you're sitting in a plane, these Sony headphones on the other hand, block out the noise so effectively and efficiently that you don't feel a thing.Sound quality - 10/10 - I'm speechless when it comes to the sound quality on this, it is simply astounding. I absolutely love how Sony allows you to customise the sound - based on YOUR preference. In other words if I want to listen to a song with good bass, all I have to do is enable bass boost sound settings on the app and I can enjoy amazing, trembling bass. On the other hand if I want to listen to a more vocal pop song, I can change the setting on the app and be treated to an amazing vocal performance. This whoops the Bose QC35's a** as Bose does not have any equaliser to change the sound settings. Basically with Bose - what you hear is what you get.Battery Backup - 10/10 - I kid you not, I listened to music for close to an hour, and when I checked the battery, it said 100%, not even kidding, dead serious. It easily gives you 30 + hours (with NC active), and perhaps more than 35 without.Touch controls - 9/10 - the touch controls are really amazing as well, but they require patience to learn and will take you a while to get accustomed to their usage, once you get a hang of it, they are really nice.In the box - one pair of headphones, one 6 inch usb C charging cable WITHOUT adapter and one headphone jack.I would recommend downloading the Sony Headphone Connect app while setting up these headphones for best results.You can use it without the app as well, but you're missing out on amazing sound personalisation and customisation if you choose not to get it.My final verdict - if you can afford it, go for it. Highly recommended!"

Premium Sound. Next level Product",4.0,"When you listen to music, not many people understand the finer elements of a composition. SONY WH-1000XM3 surprises us and gives a new premium feeling for the ears. This is almost 3 month after purchase reviewPROS -Sony really stands out when it comes to XM series. Talking about this device, it gives great comfort to ears. The cushions are very soft. I can wear it for almost 2 hrs straight. I have even taken naps also wearing this so build quality is pretty awesome. It got dropped accidentally but still no damages at all. It doesn’t fall out during workouts. It’s water resistant but not water proof so don’t drop it in the pool. It fits all heads and super easy to carry as these are not heavy at all. The overhead has very soft cushion.The sound is more towards bass if you turn the volume to full. You can feel vibration sensation when you are listening to some punchy music which itself was great feeling for me.Coming to ANC, it’s the king as compared to the products at this price segment. It can almost cut down the traffic noise . There are 3 modes of noise cancellation that can be set from the app. It can also detect your motion and set the ANC levels according to it .NFC is a cool feature , works only with android. Battery is pretty decent. It last about 10 hrs with ANC on and almost 20hrs with it off. Charging is pretty quick but make sure you don’t charge it with a big charger than 20w (don’t use any Oneplus chargers or the bigger adapters) . It has a fast charge. 3 hrs is the full charge time.CONS-The headphones and the case both needs to be cleaned otherwise the black matte finish model gets dirty. Not that pleasing for treble music lovers. It doesn’t have auto play/pause, which should have been provided for this price.Overall, this is a worth buying product. If you are someone who wants to step up and enjoy music , this is the stepping stone. Although it’s successors have some updates but one should purchase this product while entering in ANC world."

My honest review of XM3s and parallel with bose",5.0,"I pre ordered this from Amazon on the 12th of October and received the product on 22nd after launch on 18th. Others from normal orders received it before me. Don't ever trust Amazon with pre-orders, no one there knows what pre order ACTUALLY MEANS.On 24TH OCT (2 days later) I noticed a weird noise kinda faint static on the right ear cup when the ANC turned ON. Returned the defective one and got the replacement on 26th October. A lot of others have reported this issue. This is defect is on few devices. Think of it as a minor annoyance. But even with the defect I was excited each time I used it.Keep in mind that this noise is so faint that you have turn off music to be able to notice. For me it was on the right ear cup, but people have reported this noise from either of ear cups.Apart from XM3, I have both Sony XM2, BOSE QC 35 II. Xm3 hands down the best in NC Performance. The sound quality is great, it's bass heavy (compared to the 2 above) so I like to listen to XM3 more than bose, which sounds flat and doesn't get you immersed. For context: I listen to heavy metal and rock music. The customizer in the app is awesome. Sony just sounds better than bose, maybe partly also because of hi-res audio, more HD  Codec support like LDAC,  SBC ETC.Mic and phone call performance on M3s is on par with bose. Bose is better. But XM2s were worst. I take calls from noisy environments like co work space, open parking are zone with wind gushing, in cabs in bus, etc others never complained one single time about my voice being inaudible.When you open the device it comes with 100 percentage battery charged. Sony is great, come XM2 AND BOSE, comes with 70 percent. One weird this is if app is not connect and registered it the devise says low battery even though it's fully charged.So I typically use bose when I work at office as daily driver (as it also has multi device connectivity).M3s have come a long way on comfort, and now the only con with xm3 is that my ear sweats a lot, this doesn't happen with Bose quietcomfort. I like the love the gesture controls on M3 more than button on bose. I wish there was way to lock down touch to limit unintended touch triggers.Wrt to battery life is AWESOME. One really can't ask for more. There is no standby battery discharge, my observation over 5 days of no activity. The auto off does not work because any one device is always connected.On the build quality, I like bose better. Honestly, this is the only area I like bose better.Closing thoughts, Bose is my daily driver because it allows me to connect with Mac and phone same time. I can swap and connect calls easily. Also the sound signature isn't immersive, allows me to work even when the music is on. XM3s for me are the special ones, I use them for the special 'me' time. When I am looking to just enjoy music.PS. I am a developer / maker of Story Stream a platform to publish and stream immersive audio stories narrated by RJs and Voice artists. Story stream is live on Alex and coming soon on Google assistant devices. I use these headpphones for testing my apps ;) (if you have Alexa, you can enable Story Stream from the store)And that's the only reason why I have 3 expensive headphones. If I had to pick one, it's will be XM3 in a heart beat, even though it a good 15days old now, I get excited everytime I pick it up from the case to wear! Even though the bose is newer, I don't get as excited.If you have the budget, go for it. I can guarantee that you will be very excited about using it each time you put it on. This comes from some one who got a defective product, I swear even with the defective piece I was so excited about using it each time till the replacement arrived. Honestly Sony has done a tremendous job on XM3."

Better than ATH M50x, Sennheiser HD598 in noisy environments!",5.0,"I have Audio Technica ATH M50x and Sennheiser HD598 headphones that I've been using for the past 4 years. I also have Yamaha HS5 studio monitors. These are the baseline of comparison for me. I'd never wanted to buy another headphones for myself as I was already set with the two headphones (1 open back and 1 closed back) and a pair of excellent near field studio monitors for my recording deck. But one day my brother got these and was listening to them. I casually tried them on and was blown away by the noise cancellation prowess of these pair. And also was thoroughly impressed by the freedom wireless headphones offered. I was always of the opinion that wired headphone's sound quality could never be matched by a wireless headphones. It's true but these come pretty damn close!Things I absolutely love about the headphones are;1. Noise Cancellation is wonderful!. Whatever happens around you is barely audible as soon as you put these on. It may be weird at first but you get used to the active noise cancellation. And once the music starts playing, you're completely isolated in your own world. Nothing comes through once you put these on. I just totally love that about these headphones.2. Sound Quality: Now this is subjective. There are certain aspects of sound that I like in each of my headphones. On my M50x I like the analytical sound and I like that I can pick up anything and everything. But it gets a little too shrill and piercing because it's treble is too powerful and can be very very fatiguing. As for my HD598, being open back, they have good sound stage and they have the sennheiser veil. They are warm and almost flat. For laid back music listening they are wonderful and you can listen to them for 8 to 10 hours without any discomfort!. As for these, they are the best of both the worlds. The highs are clear and you can pick out the details in all the songs. The bass is wonderfully tight and strong. I've not seen such bass either in M50x or HD598. And I just love it. Even though I prefer the flat sound signature of HD598, I still like the slightly accentuated bass in these cans.3. The convenience: This was what pushed me to purchase. I can't believe how angry I got when every manufacturer in the world started removing the 3.5 mm Headphone jack. I wowed to never buy phones without headphone jack and also mentally became judgmental about wireless headphones. But after seeing my brother's Sony WH-1000XM3s I understood what I was missing out on. It's the convenience.... Not the sound quality or comfort or anything else that gets to you. I now use the headphones more often. So, essentially I'm getting more out of the money I spent on these. (And these are not cheap!). Battery life seems to be as advertised. I used these cans for almost 10 hours straight for the first 3 days and then had to charge them. These charge up in about half hour. Very nice feature.What I dislike....1. Comfort: I have large ears. Even though the cups are large enough that my big ears fit in them, they are not deep enough. After about an hour my ears start getting pinched and I have to adjust them or remove them for 1 or 2 minutes. Curiously enough, this only happens on the right earcup. Either my right earlobe is disproportionately large or the headphone cup is heavier on right side because of battery, because I've noticed that when you charge the headphones, the right earcup heats up. So either the charging circuit is there or the battery is. Whatever it might be, comfort is not as good as the sennheiser. I wouldn't even compare these with M50x on comfort because M50x suck at comfort! These are far better than M50x in comfort and a little worse than sennheiser HD598.2. Mids: As mentioned previously, I like flat sound signature, and these cans have recessed mids. The voices and instruments in the vocal range (like woodwinds) sound muted on these cans. Whereas on Sennheiser HD598 they are crystal clear. Perhaps my ears need to get used to the sound signature or have become accoustomed to flat sounding headphones. Whatever the case might be, mids are lower than bass and treble sounds in these cans. This doesn't take away from the musicality of the headphones though. The tracks sound wonderfully nice on these. You just need to turn up the volume to hear the voices (which in turn makes the instruments louder as well!) The male voices get muted a little. but female voices sound alright.In terms of sound quality considering my tastesSony WH-1000XM3 --- 8.8/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 9.6/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 9.4/10Yamaha HS5 --- 9.8/10 (you can hear everything in these :-)ComfortSony WH-1000XM3 --- 8.5/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 9/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 6/10Yamaha HS5 --- 10/10 (you don't need to wear them)Portability/Convenience. This should be your deciding factor to buy them or not.Sony WH-1000XM3 --- 10/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 7/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 7/10Yamaha HS5 --- 0/10 (these weigh 20 kgs and need wires and a sound card to run)Other considerations1. Call quality is decent over the phone but doesn't do well with Whatsapp video call or google hangouts or Cisco Webex (Yes I used these for meetings just to see how good the microphones were. It turns out that direct calls are fine but anything else and they fall apart).2. Controls: They are a little finicky. I'd have liked physical buttons that have a certainty to them. Here you're sometimes not sure if your action has been registered. Also when your fingers are sweaty, they don't slide as easily as you'd like them to. This causes noise due to finger dragging with friction over the control surface.Overall, I'd recommend this to everyone who wants to isolate themselves from the outside world. These are very good at that. But for pure sound quality or absolute comfort, I'd still recommend wired headphones like Sennheiser HD598. The problem with wireless headphones is that the technology (bluetooth) is still advancing and it might be 5 more years until it catches up to the quality of wired headphones. Then wireless headphones will fully take over the wired headphones market because only in sound quality department wireless headphones are lacking right now. The technology of wired headphones has come to its peak. There's nothing more to be done in that. The future is indeed wireless headphones with active noise cancellation. There's a lot to be done in this aspect. These technologies are still nascent. There's lot of scope of improvement in terms of pairing ease, bandwidth of bluetooth connection, battery life and noise cancellation algorithms.These are for people who travel a lot and need sound isolation to enjoy music. These are for people who like convenience over absolute sound quality. Bluetooth technology hasn't yet caught up with the wired headphone sound quality. But it will soon. These headphones are almost there.I wrote this review because no one has been comparing wireless headphones with wired ones. I hope it helps someone who is deciding to get a new phone that doesn't have a headphone jack. If you value absolute sound quality, don't get a phone without headphone jack. The wired headphones still offer better value and sound quality but at the expense of convenience."

Beats the competition",5.0,"Before I start with the review, let me make it clear that my tryst with noise cancellation headphones began in 2012 with the humble yet impressive Nokia BH-905 which I purchased for around 300 USD. My desire for good headphones started in the year 2008 with the wired Bose headphones and another Bose headphone a few years later. I am the proud owner of the Sennheiser PXC 550 for the past 3 years and have used it extensively to the extent that the leatherette coating has worn out beyond salvation.Although I do not claim myself to be an audiophile, I will do my best to review the Sony WH-1000XM3 to the best of my ability. This review will also compare the 1000 XM3 to the PXC 550.Packaging :-------------The headphones arrived in a decent box. The build quality of the box could be improved. The PXC 550 were packed in a much better built box. The product is made in Malaysia.Carrying case :-----------------The carrying case, although hard, is of average quality. The PXC 550 has a softer case in comparison. None of them come even closer to the immaculate carrying case which was provided with the Nokia BH-905 in 2012 !!!Build quality :----------------The 1000XM3 is pretty robust. I did not find much difference when compared to PXC 550. The main difference is that the earcups have a free sideways movement and no hard clicks. There could be confusion as to which one is left ear and which one is right. It will take some time to make peace with the fact that the left earcup has an NFC symbol on it.Ergonomics :---------------While I was used to the PXC 550 with all the buttons on its right side, the 1000 XM3 is in sharp contrast with the buttons on its left side. There is a multifunction button and a power button. The touch pad is located on the right side. There is a USB C charging port on the right side ( the updated PXC 550 still has a micro usb port )The head band is of decent quality and I did not face any trouble wearing the headphones.The earcups when compared to the PXC 550 are a tad uncomfortable to wear. While it is a known fact that around ear noise cancellation headphones will make your ears sweat after say, 2 hours of usage, I felt more comfortable with the PXC 550. Also the 1000 XM3 has an additional cushioning in front of the sound driver which is bound to  touch the ear pinna and cause you some irritation until such time that you get used to wearing the headphones.The headphones will definitely make your ears sweat. Period.So don't buy these headphones (or any around ear noise cancellation headphones for that matter ) to complain that the ears sweat !!!Noise cancellation :----------------------The 1000XM3 beats the competition upfront when it comes to noise cancellation. There is a feature to calibrate the noise cancellation and optimize it as per the situation, The multifunction button toggles between normal mode, ambience mode and noise cancellation mode. There is a feature where the noise cancellation levels can be adjusted for sitting, walking, running and transport. If ambient sound control is switched on, this feature will automatically adjust the noise cancellation levels as set by the user.Those who keep complaining about some ear pressure, please note that this is the basis on which noise cancellation works and hence there is bound to be some discomfort when noise cancellation is active. Take this from a person who has been regularly using noise cancelling headphones for the past 8 years.Sound quality :-----------------I never bothered to ponder over the sound quality when using the PXC 550 as I trusted a 30k headphone to sound well. But when I got my hands on the 1000 XM3, I did an upfront comparison between the two and I found out that the 1000 XM3 definitely sound better (by a small margin) than the PXC 550. Some rogue reviews mentioned that Sony has more bass than the others. I disagree with this statement. The 1000 XM3 has a punchier sound than the PXC 550 and hence one gets a feeling of more bass in comparison. On a lighter note, there is an option to increase bass levels using the software if the headphones aren't doing enough already !!!Connectivity :----------------Found no issues with connectivity. When compared to the PXC 550, the Bluetooth signal was just about the same strength, although the PXC 550 are a bit better. I tried out the headphones with a windows 10 laptop as well and found no issues. The headphones worked fine with my iPad air.The wired connection worked without any issues.The NFC function also worked fine.Touchpad :-------------The touch pad does a pretty decent job. But when I compare to the PXC 550, I felt that the 1000 XM3 has a slower response although it should not be much of a bother.On a positive note, there is a feature of lowering the music volume by just touching the touchpad with the palm. This feature is very useful when you want to listen to somebody without removing the headphones.Battery life :--------------The claimed battery life is 30 hours under test conditions. I did not bother to break my head over the number of hours I got with a single charge.Software :------------This is one factor where the 1000 XM3 outperform the PXC 550 by a big margin. The Sennheiser software was just a gimmick where the user could not do much than check the battery level of the headphones and a few other settings. The Sony software is very detailed with numerous settings and you can really control your headphones using the software. The headphone firmware was updated when I first connected them using the software. Beware that the update takes around 45 minutes to complete and you need to be patient.Conclusion :--------------For 19.3k during the Prime day sale, I am more than happy with these headphones. I did have an option to buy the updated PXC 550 or the Bose QC 35, but I chose to go ahead with Sony.One common issue with any premium headphone is the availability of replacement ear cushions and I still haven't been able to get one for my PXC 550. It is relatively easier to get one for the QC 35 and I hope that I don't have to beat around the bush much to get a replacement cushion for the 1000 XM3 in the near future."

Expensive but the way to go! my FIRST Noise Cancellation Headphones!",5.0,"This is my FIRST Noise Cancellation Headphones! So NOT AN Expert opinion :P-) Noise Cancellation is like using a tight In-Ear headphones But this is more comfortable-) This will block external noise like AC, FAN, Rain etc. Block means not 100% but 80 to 90%!-) If you play music! You will not hear anything from outside world! (As I said an In-Ear headphones do the same but it will be slightly painful)-) A tight In-Ear headphones are not a replacement for Built in Noise Cancellation! I just point it out to the people who never experienced a Noise Cancellation headphones in life. This Noise Cancellation is Another level. You will only believe it when you actually get a chance to use it. NO YouTube reviews will give you the real experience.This Noise Cancellation Headphones is useful WHEN- I watch youtube videos / tutorials- I write code- I brainstorming- I travel- I go to bed and hear some songs before sleep- I need to disconnect from the annoying world! around me :)Battery life is really good. USB-C means one less cable, Fast charging is good!, Touch control is awesome, if you put right hand to right ear cup you can come back to the world you are in. it is a huge plus, when mom are dad call me! all I need to do is put my hand on the right ear cup!Overall this NC Headphone Improved my life! Here is how.- Now I can focus more on my work- Less distraction from external noise (It is not 100% But 99% of the time it is 100%)- I hate travelling because of the the sounds and noise will influence my thoughts, I actually waste my time while travel because of that. yes a good In-Ear earphone can help but this is another level. So now I can actually do my stuff in my own world using this Noise Cancellation Headphones!Value?Yes -- if you have 30K to throw away. And it will not hurt your life in any way.No -- if you need to save money for next 12 Months to get this.Sound Quality?Base is there! If you are looking for that.But the nice thing is Sony's EQ can Adapt! That means anyone can change the Sound Aspects according to there needs from the Application. Out of the box it is perfect for my taste!If someone like less base you can change that through EQ.No product is perfect so in this Model what to improve?- Only once device can be connected at a time. (Minimum 2 devices is required now a days! [eg Laptop and SmartPhone])- User replaceable ear cup cushions!- Call Quality. This Headphones have an array of microphones but when when we call someone they will hear all Background Noise. I used it for some VOIP calls, It is usable but built in Microphones on your phone will do a much better job.- More and improved NC! Yes why not. There is always room for improvements.^^ I really don't know what to write as cons.I will Update this after using this for a week or two. bye.﻿"

Unique and awesome but can be improved!",5.0,"Reached before 12pm today on 19th. Awesome delivery service by Amazon and Appario retail.My first NC headphone and in fact  my first over the ear headphone .  Wanted a headphone with ANC so that i can hear good music even at very low volumes. This does achieve that to a large extent.Sound quality and isolation is good even without ANC turned on. What's really commendable is that the audio with the 3.5mm wired connection in the passive mode (i.e with the headphone switched off) was also quiet decent. Do note that with the wired connection you can still switch on the phone and  enable the ANC  but the app however  remains disabled .App works only when the Bluetooth is active .Found some issues  with the app. Since app is just a softwareI hope it would be updated soon  so not reducing any star . When we try to change mode from ""priority on sound quality"" to ""priority on stable connection"" and vice versa then the music stops and doesn't restart. If you want any equaliser changes these are possible only with ""priority on stable connection"". Further many times the app just forgets your last settings of Equalizer or surround sounds and just defaults to native options. Overall the app just doesn't appear premium like the headphones and is buggy. Seems the app development team was taking a nap while the hardware team was burning the midnight night oil. Comfort is good .Don't have any benchmark of BOSE so can't compare. Even tried to lie down with the headphones . Possible  if you use a pillow and want to lie sidewise. You cannot do it on regular basis but the intention was to try to see if it's possible occasionally. So I hope it should help in train journeys for masking loud snores of fellow passengers , khat-khat sound of train and getting good sleep.  When trying to do this test in my home I actually fell asleep :). The can fits into the pocket b/w pillow and the shoulder. Of course it's not a perfect fit ( like  you are not wearing your headphones at all )  but still it was possible by adjusting yourself.The touch controls do tend to get accidentally touched in this case,  say by your biceps or elbow . I hope in future updates Sony gets an option to disable/enable the touch, say by pressing both the power and the ANC button for some time.Touch controls do sometime tend to disobey you but still not a very big issue. The touch control  also responded when I tried to use a thick cloth but somehow  very not predictable.  Tried this to emulate the gloves in winters.The pad foam  do tend to get a little sweaty after around 2hrs and had to take the phones off for a few minutes . Currently the temperature is around 28deg. The phone pad foams should work very well for winters but it appears that in suumers they would tend to get warm and sweaty in case worn for long time. No comparison with Bose so can't compare relatively.ANC is good but for the first time users it does tend to create a in cabin pressure feeling. I however got accustomed to it in few hours. Thankfully there is an option to control the level of ANC.One thing I would like to mention about ANC . I tried testing the ANC with a 1500w mixer grinder and a 2000w vacuum cleaner as well. Don't assume it would mask the sound totally. I could still hear the whine if the motor very well. If you clap your hand you can still hear a thud  but all these sounds with the music on would be muted by 70-80 percent and  won't disturb you. This is just to align your expectations of the ANC. But ANC is still awesome and it would take some time to realise how awesome it is .  I was hearing coldplay at very low volumes with and without ANC , with the water tap on at full speed  ; the difference was phenomenal. And if you like cranked up volumes then of course the ANC would be even more effective.Battery is very good . Even after 3 hours of mixed  listening  on Bluetooth it was showing as 100percent. Sound quality is good and you can customise the equaliser for two of your own choices also . Bass can be tuned very well. I wish the settings got saved in the headphone rather than in the app.The music doesn't stop if you remove your headphones. Thats strange since this feature is present even in lower models like plantronics backbeat pro available,  at 11k.Regarding call quality,  I switched on the vaccum cleaner and made a call to the other party. They never complained about not hearing me. What I have found is that , unlike in some web  reviews, when making calls the ANC does remain active and the ambient noise doesn't  reach your ears or the other  person. May be the software has been tweaked since those reviews.  However it does appear as if you are talking with your ears covered by hand.  So you have  get to get used to that feeling . Overall found the call quality to be decent .If you have a balding head like me the phones tend to slip a bit :( which is just physics  . But hairy heads won't have this issue.Nevertheless I am enjoying it :)"

Recommended For Noise Cancellation",4.0,"I was a bit skeptical about buying this after reading about the static noise issues with either cups. The new version, XM4 were also revealed and available for pre-order elsewhere, and the reviews were very positive.Decided to buy these because:1. XM3 was available on sale and pricing was on par with sale prices in other parts of the world - and I could get it with Indian warranty (thought I need it after reading about the noise issues).2. XM3 is still quite good at noise cancellation when compared to XM4. XM4 would be probably launched in India around festive season (Sept-Nov) and would probably cost ~27k during sale. I didn't think I would need the improvements compared to what I save in price (9k). One would get improved sound quality due to the up-scaling chip, slightly better noise isolation, slightly more comfortable with the updated pads, play-pause music when headphone is worn-taken out, much improved mic (5 mic setup with ability to cancel cut some ambient sound) and finally support for multi-point connections (pair phone and laptop together and switch seamlessly).3. If I waited for XM4 prices to drop, rumors of XM5 with maybe a newer design will prompt one to wait even further. This is not going to end.So got these, tried them on for more than a week and here is what I think:1. If you don't need noise cancellation, then these aren't great value for the price. But if you need it, then you are looking at the one of the best. Cancels out most of the ambient sound (except voice - which you still can hear as muffled sounds - which can be masked by increasing volume a bit).2. Coming from wired headphones, these do feel heavy (these are one of the lightest noise cancelling headphones, so I wonder how comfortable the others are). But one does get used to it after a while.3. If you have never used a noise cancelling headphone in the past, ask around or visit a store to try this on. One may not like the feeling of wearing it, I for one didn't like it at all but then this is something you have to get used to when you are looking at noise cancellation. I think Bose is still more comfortable to wear.4. The bundled USB C cable is a jock. If you don't have a longer USB C cable, get one. You can use most chargers which lets you plug in a cable. Also comes with an airline adapter, good carrying case and an aux 3.5mm cable to use this wired (when battery is dead - without noise cancelling).5. Got a 1-2 months old import, made in Malaysia. So quite new, wonder why they were still making these (rumors of XM4 have been floating around for a long time, so I would have expected them to stop production).6. It supports lot of Codecs, so you don't have to worry about latency. But don't expect to game on this (connected to PC/PS4 via supplied cable), sounds quite weird with the bass rich sound profile (maybe I have to play with some setting to get it right).7. Sound quality is great for a Bluetooth headphone, but don't expect miracles if you have used decent wired or Bluetooth headphones. Much cheaper Bluetooth headphones can give you the same quality - but not coupled with similar noise isolation.8. The ear pads and padding in headband are comfortable. They are memory foam wrapped in synthetic leather. Downside is that they will get flaky after quite some time (even if you take good care of it, leave in a non-humid area). The manual has listed ear-pads as a replacement part available via authorized service center. I'm counting on that, if not, I'm sure parts will still be available from some part of the world since these sold quite well."

Sony service is the worst in the world. I have never come across such poor quality of service.",1.0,"The ProblemIt was about a few months ago that I started noticing a creaky noise from the right side of my WH-1000XM3 while listening to some audiobooks during a walk. At first, I ignored the noise as I thought it is due to my adjustments of the headband.I tried everything from removing my glasses to trying the tightest fit to get rid of the noise. To my disappointment, none of it worked.Visiting the service centre [4th July'20]I called in sony customer care who provided me with the phone no. of service centre near me. I reached out to ""iconnect"" in Gurgaon and tried describing my problem to him to which the response was that there is no need to explain to me the problem, just drive down to the service station. Surprised by the utter rudeness of attendant.I still followed the instructions and drove down to the service centre before 5 pm ( as I was instructed).I drove around 15 km to ""iconnect"" sony authorised service centre in Gurgaon. I patiently waited for my turn in an extremely warm service centre( The AC did not function). Interaction with the service centre employeeI started to describe the issue to an unengaged attendant who was still looking at his laptop screen.Me: I have been hearing squeaky noises from the right hinge of my headphones.He: ""Quiky"" without raising his head and continuing to look into his laptop.( As if the word was funny to him)Me: Excuse me!He: Yes, Sir.Me: The right side hinge makes noises even when the headphones are turned off. It is a workmanship defect.He: I haven't heard of such an issue ever.Me: But, it is an issue with my pair of headphones.He: We haven't been informed by Sony of any such issue.Meanwhile, my father started to record this interaction.To which the employee reacted aggressively that you can't record this. ( In an agitated tone)He said I won't serve you if you keep recording and left his counter.My father yielded and put his phone back into his pocket as we drove aa long way, the headphones were expensive and were going out of warranty in a few weeks.Finally, things moved forward, the service centre employee asked one of the technicians to look into the matter. We waited for another 40 mins. Meanwhile, the negative thoughts of getting my headphones messed up and with further damage crossed my mind as this place did not seem or operated professionally The Technician arrives with his analysis.The Technician: I have checked the circuitry and problem is not stemming from the electricals but is of mechanical in nature. I facepalmed myself and said to myself ""Exactly what I described, Why did you open my headphones""Next steps. The attendant spoke to a Sony employee and described him the problem over the phone & finally created a job sheet saying with the problem described as "" Abnormal noise from the right hinge even when the device is switched off""I asked him, what are the next steps, he said that he would let me know my Tuesday i.e 7th July'20 after he sends a video of this issue to the Sony Official. ( I am not too sure is the sound could be captured in a video effectively)Current status: I am patiently waiting for any update with the fear that I would be returned my old headphones which have now been open by not so professional service centre and might be prone to malfunction and since the warranty is near its end I might have to live with a product is further messed by the service centre.Update: 7th July 20The day I was promised that I would get to know what is the status of my service request.3 Sony call centre calls - Have committed me they have forwarded my concern to the service centre.5 calls to the service station- Either the some of the phones provided are always busy or out of service.I have no idea what is the status of my service request.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After calling the service centre for the 10th time they have finally replied that the headphones have been repaired and I can collect it. Which was informed to be non - repairable defect at the day of the first visit.The situation has gone bad to worse. Kindly help. I feel that I have been ripped off of my money by making this purchase decision. My request to SonyI have been a Sony customer & Fan for long, I remember our First coloured TV was a made in Japan Sony TV, which was a matter of pride for the entire family, Second was the iconic Walkman, then the flat screen Sony Wega ( I remember being mesmerised by picture quality I saw at the store), Sony Xperia U, Sony SRS-ZR7 and the latest WH-1000XM3.I believe the quality of service is the weakest link for Sony in India and this experience would deter me to move ahead or recommend Sony products to my friends and family with confidence. Kindly take this feedback and reflect on what kind of feelings do you want to invoke when a person hears the name ""Sony"". Should it invoke the feeling confidence & high quality that arises from its Japanese origins or the brand with terrible service?Buyer Beware."

Simply Astounding - Exceeds Expectations",5.0,"Prior to purchasing this product, I was a tad skeptical as I did not want to pay almost 30K for a pair of headphones.However, on further research and after reading many reviews, I decided to go for it, and after finally getting it, I am convinced that it's worth it. Let me tell you why...I purchased the silver one - purely for aesthetic reasons.. it looks great when compared to the black one, which in my opinion is just too plain. Truth be told, it is not exactly silver, more of a mixture between cream white and grey.The headphones are made out of a very good quality plastic, the inner structure is metal, and the headphone earcups are made of a very soft and comfortable leather.I would recommend wiping off any sweat or perspiration that accumulates on the leather earcups because pure leather starts flaking over time when exposed to moisture, but it's nothing to worry about too much.Comfort - 10/10 - There are many reviews which say that the fit is tight and that it makes the ears sweat. This is not entirely true, which these headphones have a slightly tighter fit as compared to the Bose QC 35s, it is not uncomfortable at all. I found it a lot more comfortable in comparison to many other headphones I have used in the past.It's slight tightness is for a very good reason  - to seal the sound in. If you take the Bose QC35s, they have a looser fit and are more comfortable, but the sound bleeds very badly, and is often embarrassing because it would disturb people sitting around you, this is not a problem with the Sonys as the sound would not bleed unless you use it at the highest volume and even then, just a little sound can be heard by others.The leather earcups are extremely comfortable as well on ear, and their quality is just plush and pristine.Noise Cancellation - 10/10 - The noise cancellation on these headphones are supposed to be the #1 industry standard out there, and this is justified, because after testing it out, it does block out almost 80% of all surrounding ambient noise.This is leagues ahead of the Bose QC35 noise cancellation. The Bose's noise cancellation has a cabin pressure like feel, it gets uncomfortable after a while and gives you a mild headache and sometimes makes your ears pop - just like when you're sitting in a plane, these Sony headphones on the other hand, block out the noise so effectively and efficiently that you don't feel a thing.Sound quality - 10/10 - I'm speechless when it comes to the sound quality on this, it is simply astounding. I absolutely love how Sony allows you to customise the sound - based on YOUR preference. In other words if I want to listen to a song with good bass, all I have to do is enable bass boost sound settings on the app and I can enjoy amazing, trembling bass. On the other hand if I want to listen to a more vocal pop song, I can change the setting on the app and be treated to an amazing vocal performance. This whoops the Bose QC35's a** as Bose does not have any equaliser to change the sound settings. Basically with Bose - what you hear is what you get.Battery Backup - 10/10 - I kid you not, I listened to music for close to an hour, and when I checked the battery, it said 100%, not even kidding, dead serious. It easily gives you 30 + hours (with NC active), and perhaps more than 35 without.Touch controls - 9/10 - the touch controls are really amazing as well, but they require patience to learn and will take you a while to get accustomed to their usage, once you get a hang of it, they are really nice.In the box - one pair of headphones, one 6 inch usb C charging cable WITHOUT adapter and one headphone jack.I would recommend downloading the Sony Headphone Connect app while setting up these headphones for best results.You can use it without the app as well, but you're missing out on amazing sound personalisation and customisation if you choose not to get it.My final verdict - if you can afford it, go for it. Highly recommended!"

Premium Sound. Next level Product",4.0,"When you listen to music, not many people understand the finer elements of a composition. SONY WH-1000XM3 surprises us and gives a new premium feeling for the ears. This is almost 3 month after purchase reviewPROS -Sony really stands out when it comes to XM series. Talking about this device, it gives great comfort to ears. The cushions are very soft. I can wear it for almost 2 hrs straight. I have even taken naps also wearing this so build quality is pretty awesome. It got dropped accidentally but still no damages at all. It doesn’t fall out during workouts. It’s water resistant but not water proof so don’t drop it in the pool. It fits all heads and super easy to carry as these are not heavy at all. The overhead has very soft cushion.The sound is more towards bass if you turn the volume to full. You can feel vibration sensation when you are listening to some punchy music which itself was great feeling for me.Coming to ANC, it’s the king as compared to the products at this price segment. It can almost cut down the traffic noise . There are 3 modes of noise cancellation that can be set from the app. It can also detect your motion and set the ANC levels according to it .NFC is a cool feature , works only with android. Battery is pretty decent. It last about 10 hrs with ANC on and almost 20hrs with it off. Charging is pretty quick but make sure you don’t charge it with a big charger than 20w (don’t use any Oneplus chargers or the bigger adapters) . It has a fast charge. 3 hrs is the full charge time.CONS-The headphones and the case both needs to be cleaned otherwise the black matte finish model gets dirty. Not that pleasing for treble music lovers. It doesn’t have auto play/pause, which should have been provided for this price.Overall, this is a worth buying product. If you are someone who wants to step up and enjoy music , this is the stepping stone. Although it’s successors have some updates but one should purchase this product while entering in ANC world."

My honest review of XM3s and parallel with bose",5.0,"I pre ordered this from Amazon on the 12th of October and received the product on 22nd after launch on 18th. Others from normal orders received it before me. Don't ever trust Amazon with pre-orders, no one there knows what pre order ACTUALLY MEANS.On 24TH OCT (2 days later) I noticed a weird noise kinda faint static on the right ear cup when the ANC turned ON. Returned the defective one and got the replacement on 26th October. A lot of others have reported this issue. This is defect is on few devices. Think of it as a minor annoyance. But even with the defect I was excited each time I used it.Keep in mind that this noise is so faint that you have turn off music to be able to notice. For me it was on the right ear cup, but people have reported this noise from either of ear cups.Apart from XM3, I have both Sony XM2, BOSE QC 35 II. Xm3 hands down the best in NC Performance. The sound quality is great, it's bass heavy (compared to the 2 above) so I like to listen to XM3 more than bose, which sounds flat and doesn't get you immersed. For context: I listen to heavy metal and rock music. The customizer in the app is awesome. Sony just sounds better than bose, maybe partly also because of hi-res audio, more HD  Codec support like LDAC,  SBC ETC.Mic and phone call performance on M3s is on par with bose. Bose is better. But XM2s were worst. I take calls from noisy environments like co work space, open parking are zone with wind gushing, in cabs in bus, etc others never complained one single time about my voice being inaudible.When you open the device it comes with 100 percentage battery charged. Sony is great, come XM2 AND BOSE, comes with 70 percent. One weird this is if app is not connect and registered it the devise says low battery even though it's fully charged.So I typically use bose when I work at office as daily driver (as it also has multi device connectivity).M3s have come a long way on comfort, and now the only con with xm3 is that my ear sweats a lot, this doesn't happen with Bose quietcomfort. I like the love the gesture controls on M3 more than button on bose. I wish there was way to lock down touch to limit unintended touch triggers.Wrt to battery life is AWESOME. One really can't ask for more. There is no standby battery discharge, my observation over 5 days of no activity. The auto off does not work because any one device is always connected.On the build quality, I like bose better. Honestly, this is the only area I like bose better.Closing thoughts, Bose is my daily driver because it allows me to connect with Mac and phone same time. I can swap and connect calls easily. Also the sound signature isn't immersive, allows me to work even when the music is on. XM3s for me are the special ones, I use them for the special 'me' time. When I am looking to just enjoy music.PS. I am a developer / maker of Story Stream a platform to publish and stream immersive audio stories narrated by RJs and Voice artists. Story stream is live on Alex and coming soon on Google assistant devices. I use these headpphones for testing my apps ;) (if you have Alexa, you can enable Story Stream from the store)And that's the only reason why I have 3 expensive headphones. If I had to pick one, it's will be XM3 in a heart beat, even though it a good 15days old now, I get excited everytime I pick it up from the case to wear! Even though the bose is newer, I don't get as excited.If you have the budget, go for it. I can guarantee that you will be very excited about using it each time you put it on. This comes from some one who got a defective product, I swear even with the defective piece I was so excited about using it each time till the replacement arrived. Honestly Sony has done a tremendous job on XM3."

Better than ATH M50x, Sennheiser HD598 in noisy environments!",5.0,"I have Audio Technica ATH M50x and Sennheiser HD598 headphones that I've been using for the past 4 years. I also have Yamaha HS5 studio monitors. These are the baseline of comparison for me. I'd never wanted to buy another headphones for myself as I was already set with the two headphones (1 open back and 1 closed back) and a pair of excellent near field studio monitors for my recording deck. But one day my brother got these and was listening to them. I casually tried them on and was blown away by the noise cancellation prowess of these pair. And also was thoroughly impressed by the freedom wireless headphones offered. I was always of the opinion that wired headphone's sound quality could never be matched by a wireless headphones. It's true but these come pretty damn close!Things I absolutely love about the headphones are;1. Noise Cancellation is wonderful!. Whatever happens around you is barely audible as soon as you put these on. It may be weird at first but you get used to the active noise cancellation. And once the music starts playing, you're completely isolated in your own world. Nothing comes through once you put these on. I just totally love that about these headphones.2. Sound Quality: Now this is subjective. There are certain aspects of sound that I like in each of my headphones. On my M50x I like the analytical sound and I like that I can pick up anything and everything. But it gets a little too shrill and piercing because it's treble is too powerful and can be very very fatiguing. As for my HD598, being open back, they have good sound stage and they have the sennheiser veil. They are warm and almost flat. For laid back music listening they are wonderful and you can listen to them for 8 to 10 hours without any discomfort!. As for these, they are the best of both the worlds. The highs are clear and you can pick out the details in all the songs. The bass is wonderfully tight and strong. I've not seen such bass either in M50x or HD598. And I just love it. Even though I prefer the flat sound signature of HD598, I still like the slightly accentuated bass in these cans.3. The convenience: This was what pushed me to purchase. I can't believe how angry I got when every manufacturer in the world started removing the 3.5 mm Headphone jack. I wowed to never buy phones without headphone jack and also mentally became judgmental about wireless headphones. But after seeing my brother's Sony WH-1000XM3s I understood what I was missing out on. It's the convenience.... Not the sound quality or comfort or anything else that gets to you. I now use the headphones more often. So, essentially I'm getting more out of the money I spent on these. (And these are not cheap!). Battery life seems to be as advertised. I used these cans for almost 10 hours straight for the first 3 days and then had to charge them. These charge up in about half hour. Very nice feature.What I dislike....1. Comfort: I have large ears. Even though the cups are large enough that my big ears fit in them, they are not deep enough. After about an hour my ears start getting pinched and I have to adjust them or remove them for 1 or 2 minutes. Curiously enough, this only happens on the right earcup. Either my right earlobe is disproportionately large or the headphone cup is heavier on right side because of battery, because I've noticed that when you charge the headphones, the right earcup heats up. So either the charging circuit is there or the battery is. Whatever it might be, comfort is not as good as the sennheiser. I wouldn't even compare these with M50x on comfort because M50x suck at comfort! These are far better than M50x in comfort and a little worse than sennheiser HD598.2. Mids: As mentioned previously, I like flat sound signature, and these cans have recessed mids. The voices and instruments in the vocal range (like woodwinds) sound muted on these cans. Whereas on Sennheiser HD598 they are crystal clear. Perhaps my ears need to get used to the sound signature or have become accoustomed to flat sounding headphones. Whatever the case might be, mids are lower than bass and treble sounds in these cans. This doesn't take away from the musicality of the headphones though. The tracks sound wonderfully nice on these. You just need to turn up the volume to hear the voices (which in turn makes the instruments louder as well!) The male voices get muted a little. but female voices sound alright.In terms of sound quality considering my tastesSony WH-1000XM3 --- 8.8/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 9.6/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 9.4/10Yamaha HS5 --- 9.8/10 (you can hear everything in these :-)ComfortSony WH-1000XM3 --- 8.5/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 9/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 6/10Yamaha HS5 --- 10/10 (you don't need to wear them)Portability/Convenience. This should be your deciding factor to buy them or not.Sony WH-1000XM3 --- 10/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 7/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 7/10Yamaha HS5 --- 0/10 (these weigh 20 kgs and need wires and a sound card to run)Other considerations1. Call quality is decent over the phone but doesn't do well with Whatsapp video call or google hangouts or Cisco Webex (Yes I used these for meetings just to see how good the microphones were. It turns out that direct calls are fine but anything else and they fall apart).2. Controls: They are a little finicky. I'd have liked physical buttons that have a certainty to them. Here you're sometimes not sure if your action has been registered. Also when your fingers are sweaty, they don't slide as easily as you'd like them to. This causes noise due to finger dragging with friction over the control surface.Overall, I'd recommend this to everyone who wants to isolate themselves from the outside world. These are very good at that. But for pure sound quality or absolute comfort, I'd still recommend wired headphones like Sennheiser HD598. The problem with wireless headphones is that the technology (bluetooth) is still advancing and it might be 5 more years until it catches up to the quality of wired headphones. Then wireless headphones will fully take over the wired headphones market because only in sound quality department wireless headphones are lacking right now. The technology of wired headphones has come to its peak. There's nothing more to be done in that. The future is indeed wireless headphones with active noise cancellation. There's a lot to be done in this aspect. These technologies are still nascent. There's lot of scope of improvement in terms of pairing ease, bandwidth of bluetooth connection, battery life and noise cancellation algorithms.These are for people who travel a lot and need sound isolation to enjoy music. These are for people who like convenience over absolute sound quality. Bluetooth technology hasn't yet caught up with the wired headphone sound quality. But it will soon. These headphones are almost there.I wrote this review because no one has been comparing wireless headphones with wired ones. I hope it helps someone who is deciding to get a new phone that doesn't have a headphone jack. If you value absolute sound quality, don't get a phone without headphone jack. The wired headphones still offer better value and sound quality but at the expense of convenience."

Beats the competition",5.0,"Before I start with the review, let me make it clear that my tryst with noise cancellation headphones began in 2012 with the humble yet impressive Nokia BH-905 which I purchased for around 300 USD. My desire for good headphones started in the year 2008 with the wired Bose headphones and another Bose headphone a few years later. I am the proud owner of the Sennheiser PXC 550 for the past 3 years and have used it extensively to the extent that the leatherette coating has worn out beyond salvation.Although I do not claim myself to be an audiophile, I will do my best to review the Sony WH-1000XM3 to the best of my ability. This review will also compare the 1000 XM3 to the PXC 550.Packaging :-------------The headphones arrived in a decent box. The build quality of the box could be improved. The PXC 550 were packed in a much better built box. The product is made in Malaysia.Carrying case :-----------------The carrying case, although hard, is of average quality. The PXC 550 has a softer case in comparison. None of them come even closer to the immaculate carrying case which was provided with the Nokia BH-905 in 2012 !!!Build quality :----------------The 1000XM3 is pretty robust. I did not find much difference when compared to PXC 550. The main difference is that the earcups have a free sideways movement and no hard clicks. There could be confusion as to which one is left ear and which one is right. It will take some time to make peace with the fact that the left earcup has an NFC symbol on it.Ergonomics :---------------While I was used to the PXC 550 with all the buttons on its right side, the 1000 XM3 is in sharp contrast with the buttons on its left side. There is a multifunction button and a power button. The touch pad is located on the right side. There is a USB C charging port on the right side ( the updated PXC 550 still has a micro usb port )The head band is of decent quality and I did not face any trouble wearing the headphones.The earcups when compared to the PXC 550 are a tad uncomfortable to wear. While it is a known fact that around ear noise cancellation headphones will make your ears sweat after say, 2 hours of usage, I felt more comfortable with the PXC 550. Also the 1000 XM3 has an additional cushioning in front of the sound driver which is bound to  touch the ear pinna and cause you some irritation until such time that you get used to wearing the headphones.The headphones will definitely make your ears sweat. Period.So don't buy these headphones (or any around ear noise cancellation headphones for that matter ) to complain that the ears sweat !!!Noise cancellation :----------------------The 1000XM3 beats the competition upfront when it comes to noise cancellation. There is a feature to calibrate the noise cancellation and optimize it as per the situation, The multifunction button toggles between normal mode, ambience mode and noise cancellation mode. There is a feature where the noise cancellation levels can be adjusted for sitting, walking, running and transport. If ambient sound control is switched on, this feature will automatically adjust the noise cancellation levels as set by the user.Those who keep complaining about some ear pressure, please note that this is the basis on which noise cancellation works and hence there is bound to be some discomfort when noise cancellation is active. Take this from a person who has been regularly using noise cancelling headphones for the past 8 years.Sound quality :-----------------I never bothered to ponder over the sound quality when using the PXC 550 as I trusted a 30k headphone to sound well. But when I got my hands on the 1000 XM3, I did an upfront comparison between the two and I found out that the 1000 XM3 definitely sound better (by a small margin) than the PXC 550. Some rogue reviews mentioned that Sony has more bass than the others. I disagree with this statement. The 1000 XM3 has a punchier sound than the PXC 550 and hence one gets a feeling of more bass in comparison. On a lighter note, there is an option to increase bass levels using the software if the headphones aren't doing enough already !!!Connectivity :----------------Found no issues with connectivity. When compared to the PXC 550, the Bluetooth signal was just about the same strength, although the PXC 550 are a bit better. I tried out the headphones with a windows 10 laptop as well and found no issues. The headphones worked fine with my iPad air.The wired connection worked without any issues.The NFC function also worked fine.Touchpad :-------------The touch pad does a pretty decent job. But when I compare to the PXC 550, I felt that the 1000 XM3 has a slower response although it should not be much of a bother.On a positive note, there is a feature of lowering the music volume by just touching the touchpad with the palm. This feature is very useful when you want to listen to somebody without removing the headphones.Battery life :--------------The claimed battery life is 30 hours under test conditions. I did not bother to break my head over the number of hours I got with a single charge.Software :------------This is one factor where the 1000 XM3 outperform the PXC 550 by a big margin. The Sennheiser software was just a gimmick where the user could not do much than check the battery level of the headphones and a few other settings. The Sony software is very detailed with numerous settings and you can really control your headphones using the software. The headphone firmware was updated when I first connected them using the software. Beware that the update takes around 45 minutes to complete and you need to be patient.Conclusion :--------------For 19.3k during the Prime day sale, I am more than happy with these headphones. I did have an option to buy the updated PXC 550 or the Bose QC 35, but I chose to go ahead with Sony.One common issue with any premium headphone is the availability of replacement ear cushions and I still haven't been able to get one for my PXC 550. It is relatively easier to get one for the QC 35 and I hope that I don't have to beat around the bush much to get a replacement cushion for the 1000 XM3 in the near future."

Expensive but the way to go! my FIRST Noise Cancellation Headphones!",5.0,"This is my FIRST Noise Cancellation Headphones! So NOT AN Expert opinion :P-) Noise Cancellation is like using a tight In-Ear headphones But this is more comfortable-) This will block external noise like AC, FAN, Rain etc. Block means not 100% but 80 to 90%!-) If you play music! You will not hear anything from outside world! (As I said an In-Ear headphones do the same but it will be slightly painful)-) A tight In-Ear headphones are not a replacement for Built in Noise Cancellation! I just point it out to the people who never experienced a Noise Cancellation headphones in life. This Noise Cancellation is Another level. You will only believe it when you actually get a chance to use it. NO YouTube reviews will give you the real experience.This Noise Cancellation Headphones is useful WHEN- I watch youtube videos / tutorials- I write code- I brainstorming- I travel- I go to bed and hear some songs before sleep- I need to disconnect from the annoying world! around me :)Battery life is really good. USB-C means one less cable, Fast charging is good!, Touch control is awesome, if you put right hand to right ear cup you can come back to the world you are in. it is a huge plus, when mom are dad call me! all I need to do is put my hand on the right ear cup!Overall this NC Headphone Improved my life! Here is how.- Now I can focus more on my work- Less distraction from external noise (It is not 100% But 99% of the time it is 100%)- I hate travelling because of the the sounds and noise will influence my thoughts, I actually waste my time while travel because of that. yes a good In-Ear earphone can help but this is another level. So now I can actually do my stuff in my own world using this Noise Cancellation Headphones!Value?Yes -- if you have 30K to throw away. And it will not hurt your life in any way.No -- if you need to save money for next 12 Months to get this.Sound Quality?Base is there! If you are looking for that.But the nice thing is Sony's EQ can Adapt! That means anyone can change the Sound Aspects according to there needs from the Application. Out of the box it is perfect for my taste!If someone like less base you can change that through EQ.No product is perfect so in this Model what to improve?- Only once device can be connected at a time. (Minimum 2 devices is required now a days! [eg Laptop and SmartPhone])- User replaceable ear cup cushions!- Call Quality. This Headphones have an array of microphones but when when we call someone they will hear all Background Noise. I used it for some VOIP calls, It is usable but built in Microphones on your phone will do a much better job.- More and improved NC! Yes why not. There is always room for improvements.^^ I really don't know what to write as cons.I will Update this after using this for a week or two. bye.﻿"

Unique and awesome but can be improved!",5.0,"Reached before 12pm today on 19th. Awesome delivery service by Amazon and Appario retail.My first NC headphone and in fact  my first over the ear headphone .  Wanted a headphone with ANC so that i can hear good music even at very low volumes. This does achieve that to a large extent.Sound quality and isolation is good even without ANC turned on. What's really commendable is that the audio with the 3.5mm wired connection in the passive mode (i.e with the headphone switched off) was also quiet decent. Do note that with the wired connection you can still switch on the phone and  enable the ANC  but the app however  remains disabled .App works only when the Bluetooth is active .Found some issues  with the app. Since app is just a softwareI hope it would be updated soon  so not reducing any star . When we try to change mode from ""priority on sound quality"" to ""priority on stable connection"" and vice versa then the music stops and doesn't restart. If you want any equaliser changes these are possible only with ""priority on stable connection"". Further many times the app just forgets your last settings of Equalizer or surround sounds and just defaults to native options. Overall the app just doesn't appear premium like the headphones and is buggy. Seems the app development team was taking a nap while the hardware team was burning the midnight night oil. Comfort is good .Don't have any benchmark of BOSE so can't compare. Even tried to lie down with the headphones . Possible  if you use a pillow and want to lie sidewise. You cannot do it on regular basis but the intention was to try to see if it's possible occasionally. So I hope it should help in train journeys for masking loud snores of fellow passengers , khat-khat sound of train and getting good sleep.  When trying to do this test in my home I actually fell asleep :). The can fits into the pocket b/w pillow and the shoulder. Of course it's not a perfect fit ( like  you are not wearing your headphones at all )  but still it was possible by adjusting yourself.The touch controls do tend to get accidentally touched in this case,  say by your biceps or elbow . I hope in future updates Sony gets an option to disable/enable the touch, say by pressing both the power and the ANC button for some time.Touch controls do sometime tend to disobey you but still not a very big issue. The touch control  also responded when I tried to use a thick cloth but somehow  very not predictable.  Tried this to emulate the gloves in winters.The pad foam  do tend to get a little sweaty after around 2hrs and had to take the phones off for a few minutes . Currently the temperature is around 28deg. The phone pad foams should work very well for winters but it appears that in suumers they would tend to get warm and sweaty in case worn for long time. No comparison with Bose so can't compare relatively.ANC is good but for the first time users it does tend to create a in cabin pressure feeling. I however got accustomed to it in few hours. Thankfully there is an option to control the level of ANC.One thing I would like to mention about ANC . I tried testing the ANC with a 1500w mixer grinder and a 2000w vacuum cleaner as well. Don't assume it would mask the sound totally. I could still hear the whine if the motor very well. If you clap your hand you can still hear a thud  but all these sounds with the music on would be muted by 70-80 percent and  won't disturb you. This is just to align your expectations of the ANC. But ANC is still awesome and it would take some time to realise how awesome it is .  I was hearing coldplay at very low volumes with and without ANC , with the water tap on at full speed  ; the difference was phenomenal. And if you like cranked up volumes then of course the ANC would be even more effective.Battery is very good . Even after 3 hours of mixed  listening  on Bluetooth it was showing as 100percent. Sound quality is good and you can customise the equaliser for two of your own choices also . Bass can be tuned very well. I wish the settings got saved in the headphone rather than in the app.The music doesn't stop if you remove your headphones. Thats strange since this feature is present even in lower models like plantronics backbeat pro available,  at 11k.Regarding call quality,  I switched on the vaccum cleaner and made a call to the other party. They never complained about not hearing me. What I have found is that , unlike in some web  reviews, when making calls the ANC does remain active and the ambient noise doesn't  reach your ears or the other  person. May be the software has been tweaked since those reviews.  However it does appear as if you are talking with your ears covered by hand.  So you have  get to get used to that feeling . Overall found the call quality to be decent .If you have a balding head like me the phones tend to slip a bit :( which is just physics  . But hairy heads won't have this issue.Nevertheless I am enjoying it :)"

Recommended For Noise Cancellation",4.0,"I was a bit skeptical about buying this after reading about the static noise issues with either cups. The new version, XM4 were also revealed and available for pre-order elsewhere, and the reviews were very positive.Decided to buy these because:1. XM3 was available on sale and pricing was on par with sale prices in other parts of the world - and I could get it with Indian warranty (thought I need it after reading about the noise issues).2. XM3 is still quite good at noise cancellation when compared to XM4. XM4 would be probably launched in India around festive season (Sept-Nov) and would probably cost ~27k during sale. I didn't think I would need the improvements compared to what I save in price (9k). One would get improved sound quality due to the up-scaling chip, slightly better noise isolation, slightly more comfortable with the updated pads, play-pause music when headphone is worn-taken out, much improved mic (5 mic setup with ability to cancel cut some ambient sound) and finally support for multi-point connections (pair phone and laptop together and switch seamlessly).3. If I waited for XM4 prices to drop, rumors of XM5 with maybe a newer design will prompt one to wait even further. This is not going to end.So got these, tried them on for more than a week and here is what I think:1. If you don't need noise cancellation, then these aren't great value for the price. But if you need it, then you are looking at the one of the best. Cancels out most of the ambient sound (except voice - which you still can hear as muffled sounds - which can be masked by increasing volume a bit).2. Coming from wired headphones, these do feel heavy (these are one of the lightest noise cancelling headphones, so I wonder how comfortable the others are). But one does get used to it after a while.3. If you have never used a noise cancelling headphone in the past, ask around or visit a store to try this on. One may not like the feeling of wearing it, I for one didn't like it at all but then this is something you have to get used to when you are looking at noise cancellation. I think Bose is still more comfortable to wear.4. The bundled USB C cable is a jock. If you don't have a longer USB C cable, get one. You can use most chargers which lets you plug in a cable. Also comes with an airline adapter, good carrying case and an aux 3.5mm cable to use this wired (when battery is dead - without noise cancelling).5. Got a 1-2 months old import, made in Malaysia. So quite new, wonder why they were still making these (rumors of XM4 have been floating around for a long time, so I would have expected them to stop production).6. It supports lot of Codecs, so you don't have to worry about latency. But don't expect to game on this (connected to PC/PS4 via supplied cable), sounds quite weird with the bass rich sound profile (maybe I have to play with some setting to get it right).7. Sound quality is great for a Bluetooth headphone, but don't expect miracles if you have used decent wired or Bluetooth headphones. Much cheaper Bluetooth headphones can give you the same quality - but not coupled with similar noise isolation.8. The ear pads and padding in headband are comfortable. They are memory foam wrapped in synthetic leather. Downside is that they will get flaky after quite some time (even if you take good care of it, leave in a non-humid area). The manual has listed ear-pads as a replacement part available via authorized service center. I'm counting on that, if not, I'm sure parts will still be available from some part of the world since these sold quite well."

Sony service is the worst in the world. I have never come across such poor quality of service.",1.0,"The ProblemIt was about a few months ago that I started noticing a creaky noise from the right side of my WH-1000XM3 while listening to some audiobooks during a walk. At first, I ignored the noise as I thought it is due to my adjustments of the headband.I tried everything from removing my glasses to trying the tightest fit to get rid of the noise. To my disappointment, none of it worked.Visiting the service centre [4th July'20]I called in sony customer care who provided me with the phone no. of service centre near me. I reached out to ""iconnect"" in Gurgaon and tried describing my problem to him to which the response was that there is no need to explain to me the problem, just drive down to the service station. Surprised by the utter rudeness of attendant.I still followed the instructions and drove down to the service centre before 5 pm ( as I was instructed).I drove around 15 km to ""iconnect"" sony authorised service centre in Gurgaon. I patiently waited for my turn in an extremely warm service centre( The AC did not function). Interaction with the service centre employeeI started to describe the issue to an unengaged attendant who was still looking at his laptop screen.Me: I have been hearing squeaky noises from the right hinge of my headphones.He: ""Quiky"" without raising his head and continuing to look into his laptop.( As if the word was funny to him)Me: Excuse me!He: Yes, Sir.Me: The right side hinge makes noises even when the headphones are turned off. It is a workmanship defect.He: I haven't heard of such an issue ever.Me: But, it is an issue with my pair of headphones.He: We haven't been informed by Sony of any such issue.Meanwhile, my father started to record this interaction.To which the employee reacted aggressively that you can't record this. ( In an agitated tone)He said I won't serve you if you keep recording and left his counter.My father yielded and put his phone back into his pocket as we drove aa long way, the headphones were expensive and were going out of warranty in a few weeks.Finally, things moved forward, the service centre employee asked one of the technicians to look into the matter. We waited for another 40 mins. Meanwhile, the negative thoughts of getting my headphones messed up and with further damage crossed my mind as this place did not seem or operated professionally The Technician arrives with his analysis.The Technician: I have checked the circuitry and problem is not stemming from the electricals but is of mechanical in nature. I facepalmed myself and said to myself ""Exactly what I described, Why did you open my headphones""Next steps. The attendant spoke to a Sony employee and described him the problem over the phone & finally created a job sheet saying with the problem described as "" Abnormal noise from the right hinge even when the device is switched off""I asked him, what are the next steps, he said that he would let me know my Tuesday i.e 7th July'20 after he sends a video of this issue to the Sony Official. ( I am not too sure is the sound could be captured in a video effectively)Current status: I am patiently waiting for any update with the fear that I would be returned my old headphones which have now been open by not so professional service centre and might be prone to malfunction and since the warranty is near its end I might have to live with a product is further messed by the service centre.Update: 7th July 20The day I was promised that I would get to know what is the status of my service request.3 Sony call centre calls - Have committed me they have forwarded my concern to the service centre.5 calls to the service station- Either the some of the phones provided are always busy or out of service.I have no idea what is the status of my service request.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After calling the service centre for the 10th time they have finally replied that the headphones have been repaired and I can collect it. Which was informed to be non - repairable defect at the day of the first visit.The situation has gone bad to worse. Kindly help. I feel that I have been ripped off of my money by making this purchase decision. My request to SonyI have been a Sony customer & Fan for long, I remember our First coloured TV was a made in Japan Sony TV, which was a matter of pride for the entire family, Second was the iconic Walkman, then the flat screen Sony Wega ( I remember being mesmerised by picture quality I saw at the store), Sony Xperia U, Sony SRS-ZR7 and the latest WH-1000XM3.I believe the quality of service is the weakest link for Sony in India and this experience would deter me to move ahead or recommend Sony products to my friends and family with confidence. Kindly take this feedback and reflect on what kind of feelings do you want to invoke when a person hears the name ""Sony"". Should it invoke the feeling confidence & high quality that arises from its Japanese origins or the brand with terrible service?Buyer Beware."

Simply Astounding - Exceeds Expectations",5.0,"Prior to purchasing this product, I was a tad skeptical as I did not want to pay almost 30K for a pair of headphones.However, on further research and after reading many reviews, I decided to go for it, and after finally getting it, I am convinced that it's worth it. Let me tell you why...I purchased the silver one - purely for aesthetic reasons.. it looks great when compared to the black one, which in my opinion is just too plain. Truth be told, it is not exactly silver, more of a mixture between cream white and grey.The headphones are made out of a very good quality plastic, the inner structure is metal, and the headphone earcups are made of a very soft and comfortable leather.I would recommend wiping off any sweat or perspiration that accumulates on the leather earcups because pure leather starts flaking over time when exposed to moisture, but it's nothing to worry about too much.Comfort - 10/10 - There are many reviews which say that the fit is tight and that it makes the ears sweat. This is not entirely true, which these headphones have a slightly tighter fit as compared to the Bose QC 35s, it is not uncomfortable at all. I found it a lot more comfortable in comparison to many other headphones I have used in the past.It's slight tightness is for a very good reason  - to seal the sound in. If you take the Bose QC35s, they have a looser fit and are more comfortable, but the sound bleeds very badly, and is often embarrassing because it would disturb people sitting around you, this is not a problem with the Sonys as the sound would not bleed unless you use it at the highest volume and even then, just a little sound can be heard by others.The leather earcups are extremely comfortable as well on ear, and their quality is just plush and pristine.Noise Cancellation - 10/10 - The noise cancellation on these headphones are supposed to be the #1 industry standard out there, and this is justified, because after testing it out, it does block out almost 80% of all surrounding ambient noise.This is leagues ahead of the Bose QC35 noise cancellation. The Bose's noise cancellation has a cabin pressure like feel, it gets uncomfortable after a while and gives you a mild headache and sometimes makes your ears pop - just like when you're sitting in a plane, these Sony headphones on the other hand, block out the noise so effectively and efficiently that you don't feel a thing.Sound quality - 10/10 - I'm speechless when it comes to the sound quality on this, it is simply astounding. I absolutely love how Sony allows you to customise the sound - based on YOUR preference. In other words if I want to listen to a song with good bass, all I have to do is enable bass boost sound settings on the app and I can enjoy amazing, trembling bass. On the other hand if I want to listen to a more vocal pop song, I can change the setting on the app and be treated to an amazing vocal performance. This whoops the Bose QC35's a** as Bose does not have any equaliser to change the sound settings. Basically with Bose - what you hear is what you get.Battery Backup - 10/10 - I kid you not, I listened to music for close to an hour, and when I checked the battery, it said 100%, not even kidding, dead serious. It easily gives you 30 + hours (with NC active), and perhaps more than 35 without.Touch controls - 9/10 - the touch controls are really amazing as well, but they require patience to learn and will take you a while to get accustomed to their usage, once you get a hang of it, they are really nice.In the box - one pair of headphones, one 6 inch usb C charging cable WITHOUT adapter and one headphone jack.I would recommend downloading the Sony Headphone Connect app while setting up these headphones for best results.You can use it without the app as well, but you're missing out on amazing sound personalisation and customisation if you choose not to get it.My final verdict - if you can afford it, go for it. Highly recommended!"

Premium Sound. Next level Product",4.0,"When you listen to music, not many people understand the finer elements of a composition. SONY WH-1000XM3 surprises us and gives a new premium feeling for the ears. This is almost 3 month after purchase reviewPROS -Sony really stands out when it comes to XM series. Talking about this device, it gives great comfort to ears. The cushions are very soft. I can wear it for almost 2 hrs straight. I have even taken naps also wearing this so build quality is pretty awesome. It got dropped accidentally but still no damages at all. It doesn’t fall out during workouts. It’s water resistant but not water proof so don’t drop it in the pool. It fits all heads and super easy to carry as these are not heavy at all. The overhead has very soft cushion.The sound is more towards bass if you turn the volume to full. You can feel vibration sensation when you are listening to some punchy music which itself was great feeling for me.Coming to ANC, it’s the king as compared to the products at this price segment. It can almost cut down the traffic noise . There are 3 modes of noise cancellation that can be set from the app. It can also detect your motion and set the ANC levels according to it .NFC is a cool feature , works only with android. Battery is pretty decent. It last about 10 hrs with ANC on and almost 20hrs with it off. Charging is pretty quick but make sure you don’t charge it with a big charger than 20w (don’t use any Oneplus chargers or the bigger adapters) . It has a fast charge. 3 hrs is the full charge time.CONS-The headphones and the case both needs to be cleaned otherwise the black matte finish model gets dirty. Not that pleasing for treble music lovers. It doesn’t have auto play/pause, which should have been provided for this price.Overall, this is a worth buying product. If you are someone who wants to step up and enjoy music , this is the stepping stone. Although it’s successors have some updates but one should purchase this product while entering in ANC world."

My honest review of XM3s and parallel with bose",5.0,"I pre ordered this from Amazon on the 12th of October and received the product on 22nd after launch on 18th. Others from normal orders received it before me. Don't ever trust Amazon with pre-orders, no one there knows what pre order ACTUALLY MEANS.On 24TH OCT (2 days later) I noticed a weird noise kinda faint static on the right ear cup when the ANC turned ON. Returned the defective one and got the replacement on 26th October. A lot of others have reported this issue. This is defect is on few devices. Think of it as a minor annoyance. But even with the defect I was excited each time I used it.Keep in mind that this noise is so faint that you have turn off music to be able to notice. For me it was on the right ear cup, but people have reported this noise from either of ear cups.Apart from XM3, I have both Sony XM2, BOSE QC 35 II. Xm3 hands down the best in NC Performance. The sound quality is great, it's bass heavy (compared to the 2 above) so I like to listen to XM3 more than bose, which sounds flat and doesn't get you immersed. For context: I listen to heavy metal and rock music. The customizer in the app is awesome. Sony just sounds better than bose, maybe partly also because of hi-res audio, more HD  Codec support like LDAC,  SBC ETC.Mic and phone call performance on M3s is on par with bose. Bose is better. But XM2s were worst. I take calls from noisy environments like co work space, open parking are zone with wind gushing, in cabs in bus, etc others never complained one single time about my voice being inaudible.When you open the device it comes with 100 percentage battery charged. Sony is great, come XM2 AND BOSE, comes with 70 percent. One weird this is if app is not connect and registered it the devise says low battery even though it's fully charged.So I typically use bose when I work at office as daily driver (as it also has multi device connectivity).M3s have come a long way on comfort, and now the only con with xm3 is that my ear sweats a lot, this doesn't happen with Bose quietcomfort. I like the love the gesture controls on M3 more than button on bose. I wish there was way to lock down touch to limit unintended touch triggers.Wrt to battery life is AWESOME. One really can't ask for more. There is no standby battery discharge, my observation over 5 days of no activity. The auto off does not work because any one device is always connected.On the build quality, I like bose better. Honestly, this is the only area I like bose better.Closing thoughts, Bose is my daily driver because it allows me to connect with Mac and phone same time. I can swap and connect calls easily. Also the sound signature isn't immersive, allows me to work even when the music is on. XM3s for me are the special ones, I use them for the special 'me' time. When I am looking to just enjoy music.PS. I am a developer / maker of Story Stream a platform to publish and stream immersive audio stories narrated by RJs and Voice artists. Story stream is live on Alex and coming soon on Google assistant devices. I use these headpphones for testing my apps ;) (if you have Alexa, you can enable Story Stream from the store)And that's the only reason why I have 3 expensive headphones. If I had to pick one, it's will be XM3 in a heart beat, even though it a good 15days old now, I get excited everytime I pick it up from the case to wear! Even though the bose is newer, I don't get as excited.If you have the budget, go for it. I can guarantee that you will be very excited about using it each time you put it on. This comes from some one who got a defective product, I swear even with the defective piece I was so excited about using it each time till the replacement arrived. Honestly Sony has done a tremendous job on XM3."

Better than ATH M50x, Sennheiser HD598 in noisy environments!",5.0,"I have Audio Technica ATH M50x and Sennheiser HD598 headphones that I've been using for the past 4 years. I also have Yamaha HS5 studio monitors. These are the baseline of comparison for me. I'd never wanted to buy another headphones for myself as I was already set with the two headphones (1 open back and 1 closed back) and a pair of excellent near field studio monitors for my recording deck. But one day my brother got these and was listening to them. I casually tried them on and was blown away by the noise cancellation prowess of these pair. And also was thoroughly impressed by the freedom wireless headphones offered. I was always of the opinion that wired headphone's sound quality could never be matched by a wireless headphones. It's true but these come pretty damn close!Things I absolutely love about the headphones are;1. Noise Cancellation is wonderful!. Whatever happens around you is barely audible as soon as you put these on. It may be weird at first but you get used to the active noise cancellation. And once the music starts playing, you're completely isolated in your own world. Nothing comes through once you put these on. I just totally love that about these headphones.2. Sound Quality: Now this is subjective. There are certain aspects of sound that I like in each of my headphones. On my M50x I like the analytical sound and I like that I can pick up anything and everything. But it gets a little too shrill and piercing because it's treble is too powerful and can be very very fatiguing. As for my HD598, being open back, they have good sound stage and they have the sennheiser veil. They are warm and almost flat. For laid back music listening they are wonderful and you can listen to them for 8 to 10 hours without any discomfort!. As for these, they are the best of both the worlds. The highs are clear and you can pick out the details in all the songs. The bass is wonderfully tight and strong. I've not seen such bass either in M50x or HD598. And I just love it. Even though I prefer the flat sound signature of HD598, I still like the slightly accentuated bass in these cans.3. The convenience: This was what pushed me to purchase. I can't believe how angry I got when every manufacturer in the world started removing the 3.5 mm Headphone jack. I wowed to never buy phones without headphone jack and also mentally became judgmental about wireless headphones. But after seeing my brother's Sony WH-1000XM3s I understood what I was missing out on. It's the convenience.... Not the sound quality or comfort or anything else that gets to you. I now use the headphones more often. So, essentially I'm getting more out of the money I spent on these. (And these are not cheap!). Battery life seems to be as advertised. I used these cans for almost 10 hours straight for the first 3 days and then had to charge them. These charge up in about half hour. Very nice feature.What I dislike....1. Comfort: I have large ears. Even though the cups are large enough that my big ears fit in them, they are not deep enough. After about an hour my ears start getting pinched and I have to adjust them or remove them for 1 or 2 minutes. Curiously enough, this only happens on the right earcup. Either my right earlobe is disproportionately large or the headphone cup is heavier on right side because of battery, because I've noticed that when you charge the headphones, the right earcup heats up. So either the charging circuit is there or the battery is. Whatever it might be, comfort is not as good as the sennheiser. I wouldn't even compare these with M50x on comfort because M50x suck at comfort! These are far better than M50x in comfort and a little worse than sennheiser HD598.2. Mids: As mentioned previously, I like flat sound signature, and these cans have recessed mids. The voices and instruments in the vocal range (like woodwinds) sound muted on these cans. Whereas on Sennheiser HD598 they are crystal clear. Perhaps my ears need to get used to the sound signature or have become accoustomed to flat sounding headphones. Whatever the case might be, mids are lower than bass and treble sounds in these cans. This doesn't take away from the musicality of the headphones though. The tracks sound wonderfully nice on these. You just need to turn up the volume to hear the voices (which in turn makes the instruments louder as well!) The male voices get muted a little. but female voices sound alright.In terms of sound quality considering my tastesSony WH-1000XM3 --- 8.8/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 9.6/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 9.4/10Yamaha HS5 --- 9.8/10 (you can hear everything in these :-)ComfortSony WH-1000XM3 --- 8.5/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 9/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 6/10Yamaha HS5 --- 10/10 (you don't need to wear them)Portability/Convenience. This should be your deciding factor to buy them or not.Sony WH-1000XM3 --- 10/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 7/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 7/10Yamaha HS5 --- 0/10 (these weigh 20 kgs and need wires and a sound card to run)Other considerations1. Call quality is decent over the phone but doesn't do well with Whatsapp video call or google hangouts or Cisco Webex (Yes I used these for meetings just to see how good the microphones were. It turns out that direct calls are fine but anything else and they fall apart).2. Controls: They are a little finicky. I'd have liked physical buttons that have a certainty to them. Here you're sometimes not sure if your action has been registered. Also when your fingers are sweaty, they don't slide as easily as you'd like them to. This causes noise due to finger dragging with friction over the control surface.Overall, I'd recommend this to everyone who wants to isolate themselves from the outside world. These are very good at that. But for pure sound quality or absolute comfort, I'd still recommend wired headphones like Sennheiser HD598. The problem with wireless headphones is that the technology (bluetooth) is still advancing and it might be 5 more years until it catches up to the quality of wired headphones. Then wireless headphones will fully take over the wired headphones market because only in sound quality department wireless headphones are lacking right now. The technology of wired headphones has come to its peak. There's nothing more to be done in that. The future is indeed wireless headphones with active noise cancellation. There's a lot to be done in this aspect. These technologies are still nascent. There's lot of scope of improvement in terms of pairing ease, bandwidth of bluetooth connection, battery life and noise cancellation algorithms.These are for people who travel a lot and need sound isolation to enjoy music. These are for people who like convenience over absolute sound quality. Bluetooth technology hasn't yet caught up with the wired headphone sound quality. But it will soon. These headphones are almost there.I wrote this review because no one has been comparing wireless headphones with wired ones. I hope it helps someone who is deciding to get a new phone that doesn't have a headphone jack. If you value absolute sound quality, don't get a phone without headphone jack. The wired headphones still offer better value and sound quality but at the expense of convenience."

Beats the competition",5.0,"Before I start with the review, let me make it clear that my tryst with noise cancellation headphones began in 2012 with the humble yet impressive Nokia BH-905 which I purchased for around 300 USD. My desire for good headphones started in the year 2008 with the wired Bose headphones and another Bose headphone a few years later. I am the proud owner of the Sennheiser PXC 550 for the past 3 years and have used it extensively to the extent that the leatherette coating has worn out beyond salvation.Although I do not claim myself to be an audiophile, I will do my best to review the Sony WH-1000XM3 to the best of my ability. This review will also compare the 1000 XM3 to the PXC 550.Packaging :-------------The headphones arrived in a decent box. The build quality of the box could be improved. The PXC 550 were packed in a much better built box. The product is made in Malaysia.Carrying case :-----------------The carrying case, although hard, is of average quality. The PXC 550 has a softer case in comparison. None of them come even closer to the immaculate carrying case which was provided with the Nokia BH-905 in 2012 !!!Build quality :----------------The 1000XM3 is pretty robust. I did not find much difference when compared to PXC 550. The main difference is that the earcups have a free sideways movement and no hard clicks. There could be confusion as to which one is left ear and which one is right. It will take some time to make peace with the fact that the left earcup has an NFC symbol on it.Ergonomics :---------------While I was used to the PXC 550 with all the buttons on its right side, the 1000 XM3 is in sharp contrast with the buttons on its left side. There is a multifunction button and a power button. The touch pad is located on the right side. There is a USB C charging port on the right side ( the updated PXC 550 still has a micro usb port )The head band is of decent quality and I did not face any trouble wearing the headphones.The earcups when compared to the PXC 550 are a tad uncomfortable to wear. While it is a known fact that around ear noise cancellation headphones will make your ears sweat after say, 2 hours of usage, I felt more comfortable with the PXC 550. Also the 1000 XM3 has an additional cushioning in front of the sound driver which is bound to  touch the ear pinna and cause you some irritation until such time that you get used to wearing the headphones.The headphones will definitely make your ears sweat. Period.So don't buy these headphones (or any around ear noise cancellation headphones for that matter ) to complain that the ears sweat !!!Noise cancellation :----------------------The 1000XM3 beats the competition upfront when it comes to noise cancellation. There is a feature to calibrate the noise cancellation and optimize it as per the situation, The multifunction button toggles between normal mode, ambience mode and noise cancellation mode. There is a feature where the noise cancellation levels can be adjusted for sitting, walking, running and transport. If ambient sound control is switched on, this feature will automatically adjust the noise cancellation levels as set by the user.Those who keep complaining about some ear pressure, please note that this is the basis on which noise cancellation works and hence there is bound to be some discomfort when noise cancellation is active. Take this from a person who has been regularly using noise cancelling headphones for the past 8 years.Sound quality :-----------------I never bothered to ponder over the sound quality when using the PXC 550 as I trusted a 30k headphone to sound well. But when I got my hands on the 1000 XM3, I did an upfront comparison between the two and I found out that the 1000 XM3 definitely sound better (by a small margin) than the PXC 550. Some rogue reviews mentioned that Sony has more bass than the others. I disagree with this statement. The 1000 XM3 has a punchier sound than the PXC 550 and hence one gets a feeling of more bass in comparison. On a lighter note, there is an option to increase bass levels using the software if the headphones aren't doing enough already !!!Connectivity :----------------Found no issues with connectivity. When compared to the PXC 550, the Bluetooth signal was just about the same strength, although the PXC 550 are a bit better. I tried out the headphones with a windows 10 laptop as well and found no issues. The headphones worked fine with my iPad air.The wired connection worked without any issues.The NFC function also worked fine.Touchpad :-------------The touch pad does a pretty decent job. But when I compare to the PXC 550, I felt that the 1000 XM3 has a slower response although it should not be much of a bother.On a positive note, there is a feature of lowering the music volume by just touching the touchpad with the palm. This feature is very useful when you want to listen to somebody without removing the headphones.Battery life :--------------The claimed battery life is 30 hours under test conditions. I did not bother to break my head over the number of hours I got with a single charge.Software :------------This is one factor where the 1000 XM3 outperform the PXC 550 by a big margin. The Sennheiser software was just a gimmick where the user could not do much than check the battery level of the headphones and a few other settings. The Sony software is very detailed with numerous settings and you can really control your headphones using the software. The headphone firmware was updated when I first connected them using the software. Beware that the update takes around 45 minutes to complete and you need to be patient.Conclusion :--------------For 19.3k during the Prime day sale, I am more than happy with these headphones. I did have an option to buy the updated PXC 550 or the Bose QC 35, but I chose to go ahead with Sony.One common issue with any premium headphone is the availability of replacement ear cushions and I still haven't been able to get one for my PXC 550. It is relatively easier to get one for the QC 35 and I hope that I don't have to beat around the bush much to get a replacement cushion for the 1000 XM3 in the near future."

Expensive but the way to go! my FIRST Noise Cancellation Headphones!",5.0,"This is my FIRST Noise Cancellation Headphones! So NOT AN Expert opinion :P-) Noise Cancellation is like using a tight In-Ear headphones But this is more comfortable-) This will block external noise like AC, FAN, Rain etc. Block means not 100% but 80 to 90%!-) If you play music! You will not hear anything from outside world! (As I said an In-Ear headphones do the same but it will be slightly painful)-) A tight In-Ear headphones are not a replacement for Built in Noise Cancellation! I just point it out to the people who never experienced a Noise Cancellation headphones in life. This Noise Cancellation is Another level. You will only believe it when you actually get a chance to use it. NO YouTube reviews will give you the real experience.This Noise Cancellation Headphones is useful WHEN- I watch youtube videos / tutorials- I write code- I brainstorming- I travel- I go to bed and hear some songs before sleep- I need to disconnect from the annoying world! around me :)Battery life is really good. USB-C means one less cable, Fast charging is good!, Touch control is awesome, if you put right hand to right ear cup you can come back to the world you are in. it is a huge plus, when mom are dad call me! all I need to do is put my hand on the right ear cup!Overall this NC Headphone Improved my life! Here is how.- Now I can focus more on my work- Less distraction from external noise (It is not 100% But 99% of the time it is 100%)- I hate travelling because of the the sounds and noise will influence my thoughts, I actually waste my time while travel because of that. yes a good In-Ear earphone can help but this is another level. So now I can actually do my stuff in my own world using this Noise Cancellation Headphones!Value?Yes -- if you have 30K to throw away. And it will not hurt your life in any way.No -- if you need to save money for next 12 Months to get this.Sound Quality?Base is there! If you are looking for that.But the nice thing is Sony's EQ can Adapt! That means anyone can change the Sound Aspects according to there needs from the Application. Out of the box it is perfect for my taste!If someone like less base you can change that through EQ.No product is perfect so in this Model what to improve?- Only once device can be connected at a time. (Minimum 2 devices is required now a days! [eg Laptop and SmartPhone])- User replaceable ear cup cushions!- Call Quality. This Headphones have an array of microphones but when when we call someone they will hear all Background Noise. I used it for some VOIP calls, It is usable but built in Microphones on your phone will do a much better job.- More and improved NC! Yes why not. There is always room for improvements.^^ I really don't know what to write as cons.I will Update this after using this for a week or two. bye.﻿"

Unique and awesome but can be improved!",5.0,"Reached before 12pm today on 19th. Awesome delivery service by Amazon and Appario retail.My first NC headphone and in fact  my first over the ear headphone .  Wanted a headphone with ANC so that i can hear good music even at very low volumes. This does achieve that to a large extent.Sound quality and isolation is good even without ANC turned on. What's really commendable is that the audio with the 3.5mm wired connection in the passive mode (i.e with the headphone switched off) was also quiet decent. Do note that with the wired connection you can still switch on the phone and  enable the ANC  but the app however  remains disabled .App works only when the Bluetooth is active .Found some issues  with the app. Since app is just a softwareI hope it would be updated soon  so not reducing any star . When we try to change mode from ""priority on sound quality"" to ""priority on stable connection"" and vice versa then the music stops and doesn't restart. If you want any equaliser changes these are possible only with ""priority on stable connection"". Further many times the app just forgets your last settings of Equalizer or surround sounds and just defaults to native options. Overall the app just doesn't appear premium like the headphones and is buggy. Seems the app development team was taking a nap while the hardware team was burning the midnight night oil. Comfort is good .Don't have any benchmark of BOSE so can't compare. Even tried to lie down with the headphones . Possible  if you use a pillow and want to lie sidewise. You cannot do it on regular basis but the intention was to try to see if it's possible occasionally. So I hope it should help in train journeys for masking loud snores of fellow passengers , khat-khat sound of train and getting good sleep.  When trying to do this test in my home I actually fell asleep :). The can fits into the pocket b/w pillow and the shoulder. Of course it's not a perfect fit ( like  you are not wearing your headphones at all )  but still it was possible by adjusting yourself.The touch controls do tend to get accidentally touched in this case,  say by your biceps or elbow . I hope in future updates Sony gets an option to disable/enable the touch, say by pressing both the power and the ANC button for some time.Touch controls do sometime tend to disobey you but still not a very big issue. The touch control  also responded when I tried to use a thick cloth but somehow  very not predictable.  Tried this to emulate the gloves in winters.The pad foam  do tend to get a little sweaty after around 2hrs and had to take the phones off for a few minutes . Currently the temperature is around 28deg. The phone pad foams should work very well for winters but it appears that in suumers they would tend to get warm and sweaty in case worn for long time. No comparison with Bose so can't compare relatively.ANC is good but for the first time users it does tend to create a in cabin pressure feeling. I however got accustomed to it in few hours. Thankfully there is an option to control the level of ANC.One thing I would like to mention about ANC . I tried testing the ANC with a 1500w mixer grinder and a 2000w vacuum cleaner as well. Don't assume it would mask the sound totally. I could still hear the whine if the motor very well. If you clap your hand you can still hear a thud  but all these sounds with the music on would be muted by 70-80 percent and  won't disturb you. This is just to align your expectations of the ANC. But ANC is still awesome and it would take some time to realise how awesome it is .  I was hearing coldplay at very low volumes with and without ANC , with the water tap on at full speed  ; the difference was phenomenal. And if you like cranked up volumes then of course the ANC would be even more effective.Battery is very good . Even after 3 hours of mixed  listening  on Bluetooth it was showing as 100percent. Sound quality is good and you can customise the equaliser for two of your own choices also . Bass can be tuned very well. I wish the settings got saved in the headphone rather than in the app.The music doesn't stop if you remove your headphones. Thats strange since this feature is present even in lower models like plantronics backbeat pro available,  at 11k.Regarding call quality,  I switched on the vaccum cleaner and made a call to the other party. They never complained about not hearing me. What I have found is that , unlike in some web  reviews, when making calls the ANC does remain active and the ambient noise doesn't  reach your ears or the other  person. May be the software has been tweaked since those reviews.  However it does appear as if you are talking with your ears covered by hand.  So you have  get to get used to that feeling . Overall found the call quality to be decent .If you have a balding head like me the phones tend to slip a bit :( which is just physics  . But hairy heads won't have this issue.Nevertheless I am enjoying it :)"

Recommended For Noise Cancellation",4.0,"I was a bit skeptical about buying this after reading about the static noise issues with either cups. The new version, XM4 were also revealed and available for pre-order elsewhere, and the reviews were very positive.Decided to buy these because:1. XM3 was available on sale and pricing was on par with sale prices in other parts of the world - and I could get it with Indian warranty (thought I need it after reading about the noise issues).2. XM3 is still quite good at noise cancellation when compared to XM4. XM4 would be probably launched in India around festive season (Sept-Nov) and would probably cost ~27k during sale. I didn't think I would need the improvements compared to what I save in price (9k). One would get improved sound quality due to the up-scaling chip, slightly better noise isolation, slightly more comfortable with the updated pads, play-pause music when headphone is worn-taken out, much improved mic (5 mic setup with ability to cancel cut some ambient sound) and finally support for multi-point connections (pair phone and laptop together and switch seamlessly).3. If I waited for XM4 prices to drop, rumors of XM5 with maybe a newer design will prompt one to wait even further. This is not going to end.So got these, tried them on for more than a week and here is what I think:1. If you don't need noise cancellation, then these aren't great value for the price. But if you need it, then you are looking at the one of the best. Cancels out most of the ambient sound (except voice - which you still can hear as muffled sounds - which can be masked by increasing volume a bit).2. Coming from wired headphones, these do feel heavy (these are one of the lightest noise cancelling headphones, so I wonder how comfortable the others are). But one does get used to it after a while.3. If you have never used a noise cancelling headphone in the past, ask around or visit a store to try this on. One may not like the feeling of wearing it, I for one didn't like it at all but then this is something you have to get used to when you are looking at noise cancellation. I think Bose is still more comfortable to wear.4. The bundled USB C cable is a jock. If you don't have a longer USB C cable, get one. You can use most chargers which lets you plug in a cable. Also comes with an airline adapter, good carrying case and an aux 3.5mm cable to use this wired (when battery is dead - without noise cancelling).5. Got a 1-2 months old import, made in Malaysia. So quite new, wonder why they were still making these (rumors of XM4 have been floating around for a long time, so I would have expected them to stop production).6. It supports lot of Codecs, so you don't have to worry about latency. But don't expect to game on this (connected to PC/PS4 via supplied cable), sounds quite weird with the bass rich sound profile (maybe I have to play with some setting to get it right).7. Sound quality is great for a Bluetooth headphone, but don't expect miracles if you have used decent wired or Bluetooth headphones. Much cheaper Bluetooth headphones can give you the same quality - but not coupled with similar noise isolation.8. The ear pads and padding in headband are comfortable. They are memory foam wrapped in synthetic leather. Downside is that they will get flaky after quite some time (even if you take good care of it, leave in a non-humid area). The manual has listed ear-pads as a replacement part available via authorized service center. I'm counting on that, if not, I'm sure parts will still be available from some part of the world since these sold quite well."

Sony service is the worst in the world. I have never come across such poor quality of service.",1.0,"The ProblemIt was about a few months ago that I started noticing a creaky noise from the right side of my WH-1000XM3 while listening to some audiobooks during a walk. At first, I ignored the noise as I thought it is due to my adjustments of the headband.I tried everything from removing my glasses to trying the tightest fit to get rid of the noise. To my disappointment, none of it worked.Visiting the service centre [4th July'20]I called in sony customer care who provided me with the phone no. of service centre near me. I reached out to ""iconnect"" in Gurgaon and tried describing my problem to him to which the response was that there is no need to explain to me the problem, just drive down to the service station. Surprised by the utter rudeness of attendant.I still followed the instructions and drove down to the service centre before 5 pm ( as I was instructed).I drove around 15 km to ""iconnect"" sony authorised service centre in Gurgaon. I patiently waited for my turn in an extremely warm service centre( The AC did not function). Interaction with the service centre employeeI started to describe the issue to an unengaged attendant who was still looking at his laptop screen.Me: I have been hearing squeaky noises from the right hinge of my headphones.He: ""Quiky"" without raising his head and continuing to look into his laptop.( As if the word was funny to him)Me: Excuse me!He: Yes, Sir.Me: The right side hinge makes noises even when the headphones are turned off. It is a workmanship defect.He: I haven't heard of such an issue ever.Me: But, it is an issue with my pair of headphones.He: We haven't been informed by Sony of any such issue.Meanwhile, my father started to record this interaction.To which the employee reacted aggressively that you can't record this. ( In an agitated tone)He said I won't serve you if you keep recording and left his counter.My father yielded and put his phone back into his pocket as we drove aa long way, the headphones were expensive and were going out of warranty in a few weeks.Finally, things moved forward, the service centre employee asked one of the technicians to look into the matter. We waited for another 40 mins. Meanwhile, the negative thoughts of getting my headphones messed up and with further damage crossed my mind as this place did not seem or operated professionally The Technician arrives with his analysis.The Technician: I have checked the circuitry and problem is not stemming from the electricals but is of mechanical in nature. I facepalmed myself and said to myself ""Exactly what I described, Why did you open my headphones""Next steps. The attendant spoke to a Sony employee and described him the problem over the phone & finally created a job sheet saying with the problem described as "" Abnormal noise from the right hinge even when the device is switched off""I asked him, what are the next steps, he said that he would let me know my Tuesday i.e 7th July'20 after he sends a video of this issue to the Sony Official. ( I am not too sure is the sound could be captured in a video effectively)Current status: I am patiently waiting for any update with the fear that I would be returned my old headphones which have now been open by not so professional service centre and might be prone to malfunction and since the warranty is near its end I might have to live with a product is further messed by the service centre.Update: 7th July 20The day I was promised that I would get to know what is the status of my service request.3 Sony call centre calls - Have committed me they have forwarded my concern to the service centre.5 calls to the service station- Either the some of the phones provided are always busy or out of service.I have no idea what is the status of my service request.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After calling the service centre for the 10th time they have finally replied that the headphones have been repaired and I can collect it. Which was informed to be non - repairable defect at the day of the first visit.The situation has gone bad to worse. Kindly help. I feel that I have been ripped off of my money by making this purchase decision. My request to SonyI have been a Sony customer & Fan for long, I remember our First coloured TV was a made in Japan Sony TV, which was a matter of pride for the entire family, Second was the iconic Walkman, then the flat screen Sony Wega ( I remember being mesmerised by picture quality I saw at the store), Sony Xperia U, Sony SRS-ZR7 and the latest WH-1000XM3.I believe the quality of service is the weakest link for Sony in India and this experience would deter me to move ahead or recommend Sony products to my friends and family with confidence. Kindly take this feedback and reflect on what kind of feelings do you want to invoke when a person hears the name ""Sony"". Should it invoke the feeling confidence & high quality that arises from its Japanese origins or the brand with terrible service?Buyer Beware."

Simply Astounding - Exceeds Expectations",5.0,"Prior to purchasing this product, I was a tad skeptical as I did not want to pay almost 30K for a pair of headphones.However, on further research and after reading many reviews, I decided to go for it, and after finally getting it, I am convinced that it's worth it. Let me tell you why...I purchased the silver one - purely for aesthetic reasons.. it looks great when compared to the black one, which in my opinion is just too plain. Truth be told, it is not exactly silver, more of a mixture between cream white and grey.The headphones are made out of a very good quality plastic, the inner structure is metal, and the headphone earcups are made of a very soft and comfortable leather.I would recommend wiping off any sweat or perspiration that accumulates on the leather earcups because pure leather starts flaking over time when exposed to moisture, but it's nothing to worry about too much.Comfort - 10/10 - There are many reviews which say that the fit is tight and that it makes the ears sweat. This is not entirely true, which these headphones have a slightly tighter fit as compared to the Bose QC 35s, it is not uncomfortable at all. I found it a lot more comfortable in comparison to many other headphones I have used in the past.It's slight tightness is for a very good reason  - to seal the sound in. If you take the Bose QC35s, they have a looser fit and are more comfortable, but the sound bleeds very badly, and is often embarrassing because it would disturb people sitting around you, this is not a problem with the Sonys as the sound would not bleed unless you use it at the highest volume and even then, just a little sound can be heard by others.The leather earcups are extremely comfortable as well on ear, and their quality is just plush and pristine.Noise Cancellation - 10/10 - The noise cancellation on these headphones are supposed to be the #1 industry standard out there, and this is justified, because after testing it out, it does block out almost 80% of all surrounding ambient noise.This is leagues ahead of the Bose QC35 noise cancellation. The Bose's noise cancellation has a cabin pressure like feel, it gets uncomfortable after a while and gives you a mild headache and sometimes makes your ears pop - just like when you're sitting in a plane, these Sony headphones on the other hand, block out the noise so effectively and efficiently that you don't feel a thing.Sound quality - 10/10 - I'm speechless when it comes to the sound quality on this, it is simply astounding. I absolutely love how Sony allows you to customise the sound - based on YOUR preference. In other words if I want to listen to a song with good bass, all I have to do is enable bass boost sound settings on the app and I can enjoy amazing, trembling bass. On the other hand if I want to listen to a more vocal pop song, I can change the setting on the app and be treated to an amazing vocal performance. This whoops the Bose QC35's a** as Bose does not have any equaliser to change the sound settings. Basically with Bose - what you hear is what you get.Battery Backup - 10/10 - I kid you not, I listened to music for close to an hour, and when I checked the battery, it said 100%, not even kidding, dead serious. It easily gives you 30 + hours (with NC active), and perhaps more than 35 without.Touch controls - 9/10 - the touch controls are really amazing as well, but they require patience to learn and will take you a while to get accustomed to their usage, once you get a hang of it, they are really nice.In the box - one pair of headphones, one 6 inch usb C charging cable WITHOUT adapter and one headphone jack.I would recommend downloading the Sony Headphone Connect app while setting up these headphones for best results.You can use it without the app as well, but you're missing out on amazing sound personalisation and customisation if you choose not to get it.My final verdict - if you can afford it, go for it. Highly recommended!"

Premium Sound. Next level Product",4.0,"When you listen to music, not many people understand the finer elements of a composition. SONY WH-1000XM3 surprises us and gives a new premium feeling for the ears. This is almost 3 month after purchase reviewPROS -Sony really stands out when it comes to XM series. Talking about this device, it gives great comfort to ears. The cushions are very soft. I can wear it for almost 2 hrs straight. I have even taken naps also wearing this so build quality is pretty awesome. It got dropped accidentally but still no damages at all. It doesn’t fall out during workouts. It’s water resistant but not water proof so don’t drop it in the pool. It fits all heads and super easy to carry as these are not heavy at all. The overhead has very soft cushion.The sound is more towards bass if you turn the volume to full. You can feel vibration sensation when you are listening to some punchy music which itself was great feeling for me.Coming to ANC, it’s the king as compared to the products at this price segment. It can almost cut down the traffic noise . There are 3 modes of noise cancellation that can be set from the app. It can also detect your motion and set the ANC levels according to it .NFC is a cool feature , works only with android. Battery is pretty decent. It last about 10 hrs with ANC on and almost 20hrs with it off. Charging is pretty quick but make sure you don’t charge it with a big charger than 20w (don’t use any Oneplus chargers or the bigger adapters) . It has a fast charge. 3 hrs is the full charge time.CONS-The headphones and the case both needs to be cleaned otherwise the black matte finish model gets dirty. Not that pleasing for treble music lovers. It doesn’t have auto play/pause, which should have been provided for this price.Overall, this is a worth buying product. If you are someone who wants to step up and enjoy music , this is the stepping stone. Although it’s successors have some updates but one should purchase this product while entering in ANC world."

My honest review of XM3s and parallel with bose",5.0,"I pre ordered this from Amazon on the 12th of October and received the product on 22nd after launch on 18th. Others from normal orders received it before me. Don't ever trust Amazon with pre-orders, no one there knows what pre order ACTUALLY MEANS.On 24TH OCT (2 days later) I noticed a weird noise kinda faint static on the right ear cup when the ANC turned ON. Returned the defective one and got the replacement on 26th October. A lot of others have reported this issue. This is defect is on few devices. Think of it as a minor annoyance. But even with the defect I was excited each time I used it.Keep in mind that this noise is so faint that you have turn off music to be able to notice. For me it was on the right ear cup, but people have reported this noise from either of ear cups.Apart from XM3, I have both Sony XM2, BOSE QC 35 II. Xm3 hands down the best in NC Performance. The sound quality is great, it's bass heavy (compared to the 2 above) so I like to listen to XM3 more than bose, which sounds flat and doesn't get you immersed. For context: I listen to heavy metal and rock music. The customizer in the app is awesome. Sony just sounds better than bose, maybe partly also because of hi-res audio, more HD  Codec support like LDAC,  SBC ETC.Mic and phone call performance on M3s is on par with bose. Bose is better. But XM2s were worst. I take calls from noisy environments like co work space, open parking are zone with wind gushing, in cabs in bus, etc others never complained one single time about my voice being inaudible.When you open the device it comes with 100 percentage battery charged. Sony is great, come XM2 AND BOSE, comes with 70 percent. One weird this is if app is not connect and registered it the devise says low battery even though it's fully charged.So I typically use bose when I work at office as daily driver (as it also has multi device connectivity).M3s have come a long way on comfort, and now the only con with xm3 is that my ear sweats a lot, this doesn't happen with Bose quietcomfort. I like the love the gesture controls on M3 more than button on bose. I wish there was way to lock down touch to limit unintended touch triggers.Wrt to battery life is AWESOME. One really can't ask for more. There is no standby battery discharge, my observation over 5 days of no activity. The auto off does not work because any one device is always connected.On the build quality, I like bose better. Honestly, this is the only area I like bose better.Closing thoughts, Bose is my daily driver because it allows me to connect with Mac and phone same time. I can swap and connect calls easily. Also the sound signature isn't immersive, allows me to work even when the music is on. XM3s for me are the special ones, I use them for the special 'me' time. When I am looking to just enjoy music.PS. I am a developer / maker of Story Stream a platform to publish and stream immersive audio stories narrated by RJs and Voice artists. Story stream is live on Alex and coming soon on Google assistant devices. I use these headpphones for testing my apps ;) (if you have Alexa, you can enable Story Stream from the store)And that's the only reason why I have 3 expensive headphones. If I had to pick one, it's will be XM3 in a heart beat, even though it a good 15days old now, I get excited everytime I pick it up from the case to wear! Even though the bose is newer, I don't get as excited.If you have the budget, go for it. I can guarantee that you will be very excited about using it each time you put it on. This comes from some one who got a defective product, I swear even with the defective piece I was so excited about using it each time till the replacement arrived. Honestly Sony has done a tremendous job on XM3."

Better than ATH M50x, Sennheiser HD598 in noisy environments!",5.0,"I have Audio Technica ATH M50x and Sennheiser HD598 headphones that I've been using for the past 4 years. I also have Yamaha HS5 studio monitors. These are the baseline of comparison for me. I'd never wanted to buy another headphones for myself as I was already set with the two headphones (1 open back and 1 closed back) and a pair of excellent near field studio monitors for my recording deck. But one day my brother got these and was listening to them. I casually tried them on and was blown away by the noise cancellation prowess of these pair. And also was thoroughly impressed by the freedom wireless headphones offered. I was always of the opinion that wired headphone's sound quality could never be matched by a wireless headphones. It's true but these come pretty damn close!Things I absolutely love about the headphones are;1. Noise Cancellation is wonderful!. Whatever happens around you is barely audible as soon as you put these on. It may be weird at first but you get used to the active noise cancellation. And once the music starts playing, you're completely isolated in your own world. Nothing comes through once you put these on. I just totally love that about these headphones.2. Sound Quality: Now this is subjective. There are certain aspects of sound that I like in each of my headphones. On my M50x I like the analytical sound and I like that I can pick up anything and everything. But it gets a little too shrill and piercing because it's treble is too powerful and can be very very fatiguing. As for my HD598, being open back, they have good sound stage and they have the sennheiser veil. They are warm and almost flat. For laid back music listening they are wonderful and you can listen to them for 8 to 10 hours without any discomfort!. As for these, they are the best of both the worlds. The highs are clear and you can pick out the details in all the songs. The bass is wonderfully tight and strong. I've not seen such bass either in M50x or HD598. And I just love it. Even though I prefer the flat sound signature of HD598, I still like the slightly accentuated bass in these cans.3. The convenience: This was what pushed me to purchase. I can't believe how angry I got when every manufacturer in the world started removing the 3.5 mm Headphone jack. I wowed to never buy phones without headphone jack and also mentally became judgmental about wireless headphones. But after seeing my brother's Sony WH-1000XM3s I understood what I was missing out on. It's the convenience.... Not the sound quality or comfort or anything else that gets to you. I now use the headphones more often. So, essentially I'm getting more out of the money I spent on these. (And these are not cheap!). Battery life seems to be as advertised. I used these cans for almost 10 hours straight for the first 3 days and then had to charge them. These charge up in about half hour. Very nice feature.What I dislike....1. Comfort: I have large ears. Even though the cups are large enough that my big ears fit in them, they are not deep enough. After about an hour my ears start getting pinched and I have to adjust them or remove them for 1 or 2 minutes. Curiously enough, this only happens on the right earcup. Either my right earlobe is disproportionately large or the headphone cup is heavier on right side because of battery, because I've noticed that when you charge the headphones, the right earcup heats up. So either the charging circuit is there or the battery is. Whatever it might be, comfort is not as good as the sennheiser. I wouldn't even compare these with M50x on comfort because M50x suck at comfort! These are far better than M50x in comfort and a little worse than sennheiser HD598.2. Mids: As mentioned previously, I like flat sound signature, and these cans have recessed mids. The voices and instruments in the vocal range (like woodwinds) sound muted on these cans. Whereas on Sennheiser HD598 they are crystal clear. Perhaps my ears need to get used to the sound signature or have become accoustomed to flat sounding headphones. Whatever the case might be, mids are lower than bass and treble sounds in these cans. This doesn't take away from the musicality of the headphones though. The tracks sound wonderfully nice on these. You just need to turn up the volume to hear the voices (which in turn makes the instruments louder as well!) The male voices get muted a little. but female voices sound alright.In terms of sound quality considering my tastesSony WH-1000XM3 --- 8.8/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 9.6/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 9.4/10Yamaha HS5 --- 9.8/10 (you can hear everything in these :-)ComfortSony WH-1000XM3 --- 8.5/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 9/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 6/10Yamaha HS5 --- 10/10 (you don't need to wear them)Portability/Convenience. This should be your deciding factor to buy them or not.Sony WH-1000XM3 --- 10/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 7/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 7/10Yamaha HS5 --- 0/10 (these weigh 20 kgs and need wires and a sound card to run)Other considerations1. Call quality is decent over the phone but doesn't do well with Whatsapp video call or google hangouts or Cisco Webex (Yes I used these for meetings just to see how good the microphones were. It turns out that direct calls are fine but anything else and they fall apart).2. Controls: They are a little finicky. I'd have liked physical buttons that have a certainty to them. Here you're sometimes not sure if your action has been registered. Also when your fingers are sweaty, they don't slide as easily as you'd like them to. This causes noise due to finger dragging with friction over the control surface.Overall, I'd recommend this to everyone who wants to isolate themselves from the outside world. These are very good at that. But for pure sound quality or absolute comfort, I'd still recommend wired headphones like Sennheiser HD598. The problem with wireless headphones is that the technology (bluetooth) is still advancing and it might be 5 more years until it catches up to the quality of wired headphones. Then wireless headphones will fully take over the wired headphones market because only in sound quality department wireless headphones are lacking right now. The technology of wired headphones has come to its peak. There's nothing more to be done in that. The future is indeed wireless headphones with active noise cancellation. There's a lot to be done in this aspect. These technologies are still nascent. There's lot of scope of improvement in terms of pairing ease, bandwidth of bluetooth connection, battery life and noise cancellation algorithms.These are for people who travel a lot and need sound isolation to enjoy music. These are for people who like convenience over absolute sound quality. Bluetooth technology hasn't yet caught up with the wired headphone sound quality. But it will soon. These headphones are almost there.I wrote this review because no one has been comparing wireless headphones with wired ones. I hope it helps someone who is deciding to get a new phone that doesn't have a headphone jack. If you value absolute sound quality, don't get a phone without headphone jack. The wired headphones still offer better value and sound quality but at the expense of convenience."
Amazon.in:Customer reviews: Sony WH-1000XM3 Bluetooth Wireless Over Ear Headphones with Mic (Black),Reviewed in India on 9 August 2020,"5.0 out of 5 stars
Beats the competition",5.0,"Before I start with the review, let me make it clear that my tryst with noise cancellation headphones began in 2012 with the humble yet impressive Nokia BH-905 which I purchased for around 300 USD. My desire for good headphones started in the year 2008 with the wired Bose headphones and another Bose headphone a few years later. I am the proud owner of the Sennheiser PXC 550 for the past 3 years and have used it extensively to the extent that the leatherette coating has worn out beyond salvation.Although I do not claim myself to be an audiophile, I will do my best to review the Sony WH-1000XM3 to the best of my ability. This review will also compare the 1000 XM3 to the PXC 550.Packaging :-------------The headphones arrived in a decent box. The build quality of the box could be improved. The PXC 550 were packed in a much better built box. The product is made in Malaysia.Carrying case :-----------------The carrying case, although hard, is of average quality. The PXC 550 has a softer case in comparison. None of them come even closer to the immaculate carrying case which was provided with the Nokia BH-905 in 2012 !!!Build quality :----------------The 1000XM3 is pretty robust. I did not find much difference when compared to PXC 550. The main difference is that the earcups have a free sideways movement and no hard clicks. There could be confusion as to which one is left ear and which one is right. It will take some time to make peace with the fact that the left earcup has an NFC symbol on it.Ergonomics :---------------While I was used to the PXC 550 with all the buttons on its right side, the 1000 XM3 is in sharp contrast with the buttons on its left side. There is a multifunction button and a power button. The touch pad is located on the right side. There is a USB C charging port on the right side ( the updated PXC 550 still has a micro usb port )The head band is of decent quality and I did not face any trouble wearing the headphones.The earcups when compared to the PXC 550 are a tad uncomfortable to wear. While it is a known fact that around ear noise cancellation headphones will make your ears sweat after say, 2 hours of usage, I felt more comfortable with the PXC 550. Also the 1000 XM3 has an additional cushioning in front of the sound driver which is bound to  touch the ear pinna and cause you some irritation until such time that you get used to wearing the headphones.The headphones will definitely make your ears sweat. Period.So don't buy these headphones (or any around ear noise cancellation headphones for that matter ) to complain that the ears sweat !!!Noise cancellation :----------------------The 1000XM3 beats the competition upfront when it comes to noise cancellation. There is a feature to calibrate the noise cancellation and optimize it as per the situation, The multifunction button toggles between normal mode, ambience mode and noise cancellation mode. There is a feature where the noise cancellation levels can be adjusted for sitting, walking, running and transport. If ambient sound control is switched on, this feature will automatically adjust the noise cancellation levels as set by the user.Those who keep complaining about some ear pressure, please note that this is the basis on which noise cancellation works and hence there is bound to be some discomfort when noise cancellation is active. Take this from a person who has been regularly using noise cancelling headphones for the past 8 years.Sound quality :-----------------I never bothered to ponder over the sound quality when using the PXC 550 as I trusted a 30k headphone to sound well. But when I got my hands on the 1000 XM3, I did an upfront comparison between the two and I found out that the 1000 XM3 definitely sound better (by a small margin) than the PXC 550. Some rogue reviews mentioned that Sony has more bass than the others. I disagree with this statement. The 1000 XM3 has a punchier sound than the PXC 550 and hence one gets a feeling of more bass in comparison. On a lighter note, there is an option to increase bass levels using the software if the headphones aren't doing enough already !!!Connectivity :----------------Found no issues with connectivity. When compared to the PXC 550, the Bluetooth signal was just about the same strength, although the PXC 550 are a bit better. I tried out the headphones with a windows 10 laptop as well and found no issues. The headphones worked fine with my iPad air.The wired connection worked without any issues.The NFC function also worked fine.Touchpad :-------------The touch pad does a pretty decent job. But when I compare to the PXC 550, I felt that the 1000 XM3 has a slower response although it should not be much of a bother.On a positive note, there is a feature of lowering the music volume by just touching the touchpad with the palm. This feature is very useful when you want to listen to somebody without removing the headphones.Battery life :--------------The claimed battery life is 30 hours under test conditions. I did not bother to break my head over the number of hours I got with a single charge.Software :------------This is one factor where the 1000 XM3 outperform the PXC 550 by a big margin. The Sennheiser software was just a gimmick where the user could not do much than check the battery level of the headphones and a few other settings. The Sony software is very detailed with numerous settings and you can really control your headphones using the software. The headphone firmware was updated when I first connected them using the software. Beware that the update takes around 45 minutes to complete and you need to be patient.Conclusion :--------------For 19.3k during the Prime day sale, I am more than happy with these headphones. I did have an option to buy the updated PXC 550 or the Bose QC 35, but I chose to go ahead with Sony.One common issue with any premium headphone is the availability of replacement ear cushions and I still haven't been able to get one for my PXC 550. It is relatively easier to get one for the QC 35 and I hope that I don't have to beat around the bush much to get a replacement cushion for the 1000 XM3 in the near future."

Expensive but the way to go! my FIRST Noise Cancellation Headphones!",5.0,"This is my FIRST Noise Cancellation Headphones! So NOT AN Expert opinion :P-) Noise Cancellation is like using a tight In-Ear headphones But this is more comfortable-) This will block external noise like AC, FAN, Rain etc. Block means not 100% but 80 to 90%!-) If you play music! You will not hear anything from outside world! (As I said an In-Ear headphones do the same but it will be slightly painful)-) A tight In-Ear headphones are not a replacement for Built in Noise Cancellation! I just point it out to the people who never experienced a Noise Cancellation headphones in life. This Noise Cancellation is Another level. You will only believe it when you actually get a chance to use it. NO YouTube reviews will give you the real experience.This Noise Cancellation Headphones is useful WHEN- I watch youtube videos / tutorials- I write code- I brainstorming- I travel- I go to bed and hear some songs before sleep- I need to disconnect from the annoying world! around me :)Battery life is really good. USB-C means one less cable, Fast charging is good!, Touch control is awesome, if you put right hand to right ear cup you can come back to the world you are in. it is a huge plus, when mom are dad call me! all I need to do is put my hand on the right ear cup!Overall this NC Headphone Improved my life! Here is how.- Now I can focus more on my work- Less distraction from external noise (It is not 100% But 99% of the time it is 100%)- I hate travelling because of the the sounds and noise will influence my thoughts, I actually waste my time while travel because of that. yes a good In-Ear earphone can help but this is another level. So now I can actually do my stuff in my own world using this Noise Cancellation Headphones!Value?Yes -- if you have 30K to throw away. And it will not hurt your life in any way.No -- if you need to save money for next 12 Months to get this.Sound Quality?Base is there! If you are looking for that.But the nice thing is Sony's EQ can Adapt! That means anyone can change the Sound Aspects according to there needs from the Application. Out of the box it is perfect for my taste!If someone like less base you can change that through EQ.No product is perfect so in this Model what to improve?- Only once device can be connected at a time. (Minimum 2 devices is required now a days! [eg Laptop and SmartPhone])- User replaceable ear cup cushions!- Call Quality. This Headphones have an array of microphones but when when we call someone they will hear all Background Noise. I used it for some VOIP calls, It is usable but built in Microphones on your phone will do a much better job.- More and improved NC! Yes why not. There is always room for improvements.^^ I really don't know what to write as cons.I will Update this after using this for a week or two. bye.﻿"

Unique and awesome but can be improved!",5.0,"Reached before 12pm today on 19th. Awesome delivery service by Amazon and Appario retail.My first NC headphone and in fact  my first over the ear headphone .  Wanted a headphone with ANC so that i can hear good music even at very low volumes. This does achieve that to a large extent.Sound quality and isolation is good even without ANC turned on. What's really commendable is that the audio with the 3.5mm wired connection in the passive mode (i.e with the headphone switched off) was also quiet decent. Do note that with the wired connection you can still switch on the phone and  enable the ANC  but the app however  remains disabled .App works only when the Bluetooth is active .Found some issues  with the app. Since app is just a softwareI hope it would be updated soon  so not reducing any star . When we try to change mode from ""priority on sound quality"" to ""priority on stable connection"" and vice versa then the music stops and doesn't restart. If you want any equaliser changes these are possible only with ""priority on stable connection"". Further many times the app just forgets your last settings of Equalizer or surround sounds and just defaults to native options. Overall the app just doesn't appear premium like the headphones and is buggy. Seems the app development team was taking a nap while the hardware team was burning the midnight night oil. Comfort is good .Don't have any benchmark of BOSE so can't compare. Even tried to lie down with the headphones . Possible  if you use a pillow and want to lie sidewise. You cannot do it on regular basis but the intention was to try to see if it's possible occasionally. So I hope it should help in train journeys for masking loud snores of fellow passengers , khat-khat sound of train and getting good sleep.  When trying to do this test in my home I actually fell asleep :). The can fits into the pocket b/w pillow and the shoulder. Of course it's not a perfect fit ( like  you are not wearing your headphones at all )  but still it was possible by adjusting yourself.The touch controls do tend to get accidentally touched in this case,  say by your biceps or elbow . I hope in future updates Sony gets an option to disable/enable the touch, say by pressing both the power and the ANC button for some time.Touch controls do sometime tend to disobey you but still not a very big issue. The touch control  also responded when I tried to use a thick cloth but somehow  very not predictable.  Tried this to emulate the gloves in winters.The pad foam  do tend to get a little sweaty after around 2hrs and had to take the phones off for a few minutes . Currently the temperature is around 28deg. The phone pad foams should work very well for winters but it appears that in suumers they would tend to get warm and sweaty in case worn for long time. No comparison with Bose so can't compare relatively.ANC is good but for the first time users it does tend to create a in cabin pressure feeling. I however got accustomed to it in few hours. Thankfully there is an option to control the level of ANC.One thing I would like to mention about ANC . I tried testing the ANC with a 1500w mixer grinder and a 2000w vacuum cleaner as well. Don't assume it would mask the sound totally. I could still hear the whine if the motor very well. If you clap your hand you can still hear a thud  but all these sounds with the music on would be muted by 70-80 percent and  won't disturb you. This is just to align your expectations of the ANC. But ANC is still awesome and it would take some time to realise how awesome it is .  I was hearing coldplay at very low volumes with and without ANC , with the water tap on at full speed  ; the difference was phenomenal. And if you like cranked up volumes then of course the ANC would be even more effective.Battery is very good . Even after 3 hours of mixed  listening  on Bluetooth it was showing as 100percent. Sound quality is good and you can customise the equaliser for two of your own choices also . Bass can be tuned very well. I wish the settings got saved in the headphone rather than in the app.The music doesn't stop if you remove your headphones. Thats strange since this feature is present even in lower models like plantronics backbeat pro available,  at 11k.Regarding call quality,  I switched on the vaccum cleaner and made a call to the other party. They never complained about not hearing me. What I have found is that , unlike in some web  reviews, when making calls the ANC does remain active and the ambient noise doesn't  reach your ears or the other  person. May be the software has been tweaked since those reviews.  However it does appear as if you are talking with your ears covered by hand.  So you have  get to get used to that feeling . Overall found the call quality to be decent .If you have a balding head like me the phones tend to slip a bit :( which is just physics  . But hairy heads won't have this issue.Nevertheless I am enjoying it :)"

Recommended For Noise Cancellation",4.0,"I was a bit skeptical about buying this after reading about the static noise issues with either cups. The new version, XM4 were also revealed and available for pre-order elsewhere, and the reviews were very positive.Decided to buy these because:1. XM3 was available on sale and pricing was on par with sale prices in other parts of the world - and I could get it with Indian warranty (thought I need it after reading about the noise issues).2. XM3 is still quite good at noise cancellation when compared to XM4. XM4 would be probably launched in India around festive season (Sept-Nov) and would probably cost ~27k during sale. I didn't think I would need the improvements compared to what I save in price (9k). One would get improved sound quality due to the up-scaling chip, slightly better noise isolation, slightly more comfortable with the updated pads, play-pause music when headphone is worn-taken out, much improved mic (5 mic setup with ability to cancel cut some ambient sound) and finally support for multi-point connections (pair phone and laptop together and switch seamlessly).3. If I waited for XM4 prices to drop, rumors of XM5 with maybe a newer design will prompt one to wait even further. This is not going to end.So got these, tried them on for more than a week and here is what I think:1. If you don't need noise cancellation, then these aren't great value for the price. But if you need it, then you are looking at the one of the best. Cancels out most of the ambient sound (except voice - which you still can hear as muffled sounds - which can be masked by increasing volume a bit).2. Coming from wired headphones, these do feel heavy (these are one of the lightest noise cancelling headphones, so I wonder how comfortable the others are). But one does get used to it after a while.3. If you have never used a noise cancelling headphone in the past, ask around or visit a store to try this on. One may not like the feeling of wearing it, I for one didn't like it at all but then this is something you have to get used to when you are looking at noise cancellation. I think Bose is still more comfortable to wear.4. The bundled USB C cable is a jock. If you don't have a longer USB C cable, get one. You can use most chargers which lets you plug in a cable. Also comes with an airline adapter, good carrying case and an aux 3.5mm cable to use this wired (when battery is dead - without noise cancelling).5. Got a 1-2 months old import, made in Malaysia. So quite new, wonder why they were still making these (rumors of XM4 have been floating around for a long time, so I would have expected them to stop production).6. It supports lot of Codecs, so you don't have to worry about latency. But don't expect to game on this (connected to PC/PS4 via supplied cable), sounds quite weird with the bass rich sound profile (maybe I have to play with some setting to get it right).7. Sound quality is great for a Bluetooth headphone, but don't expect miracles if you have used decent wired or Bluetooth headphones. Much cheaper Bluetooth headphones can give you the same quality - but not coupled with similar noise isolation.8. The ear pads and padding in headband are comfortable. They are memory foam wrapped in synthetic leather. Downside is that they will get flaky after quite some time (even if you take good care of it, leave in a non-humid area). The manual has listed ear-pads as a replacement part available via authorized service center. I'm counting on that, if not, I'm sure parts will still be available from some part of the world since these sold quite well."

Sony service is the worst in the world. I have never come across such poor quality of service.",1.0,"The ProblemIt was about a few months ago that I started noticing a creaky noise from the right side of my WH-1000XM3 while listening to some audiobooks during a walk. At first, I ignored the noise as I thought it is due to my adjustments of the headband.I tried everything from removing my glasses to trying the tightest fit to get rid of the noise. To my disappointment, none of it worked.Visiting the service centre [4th July'20]I called in sony customer care who provided me with the phone no. of service centre near me. I reached out to ""iconnect"" in Gurgaon and tried describing my problem to him to which the response was that there is no need to explain to me the problem, just drive down to the service station. Surprised by the utter rudeness of attendant.I still followed the instructions and drove down to the service centre before 5 pm ( as I was instructed).I drove around 15 km to ""iconnect"" sony authorised service centre in Gurgaon. I patiently waited for my turn in an extremely warm service centre( The AC did not function). Interaction with the service centre employeeI started to describe the issue to an unengaged attendant who was still looking at his laptop screen.Me: I have been hearing squeaky noises from the right hinge of my headphones.He: ""Quiky"" without raising his head and continuing to look into his laptop.( As if the word was funny to him)Me: Excuse me!He: Yes, Sir.Me: The right side hinge makes noises even when the headphones are turned off. It is a workmanship defect.He: I haven't heard of such an issue ever.Me: But, it is an issue with my pair of headphones.He: We haven't been informed by Sony of any such issue.Meanwhile, my father started to record this interaction.To which the employee reacted aggressively that you can't record this. ( In an agitated tone)He said I won't serve you if you keep recording and left his counter.My father yielded and put his phone back into his pocket as we drove aa long way, the headphones were expensive and were going out of warranty in a few weeks.Finally, things moved forward, the service centre employee asked one of the technicians to look into the matter. We waited for another 40 mins. Meanwhile, the negative thoughts of getting my headphones messed up and with further damage crossed my mind as this place did not seem or operated professionally The Technician arrives with his analysis.The Technician: I have checked the circuitry and problem is not stemming from the electricals but is of mechanical in nature. I facepalmed myself and said to myself ""Exactly what I described, Why did you open my headphones""Next steps. The attendant spoke to a Sony employee and described him the problem over the phone & finally created a job sheet saying with the problem described as "" Abnormal noise from the right hinge even when the device is switched off""I asked him, what are the next steps, he said that he would let me know my Tuesday i.e 7th July'20 after he sends a video of this issue to the Sony Official. ( I am not too sure is the sound could be captured in a video effectively)Current status: I am patiently waiting for any update with the fear that I would be returned my old headphones which have now been open by not so professional service centre and might be prone to malfunction and since the warranty is near its end I might have to live with a product is further messed by the service centre.Update: 7th July 20The day I was promised that I would get to know what is the status of my service request.3 Sony call centre calls - Have committed me they have forwarded my concern to the service centre.5 calls to the service station- Either the some of the phones provided are always busy or out of service.I have no idea what is the status of my service request.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After calling the service centre for the 10th time they have finally replied that the headphones have been repaired and I can collect it. Which was informed to be non - repairable defect at the day of the first visit.The situation has gone bad to worse. Kindly help. I feel that I have been ripped off of my money by making this purchase decision. My request to SonyI have been a Sony customer & Fan for long, I remember our First coloured TV was a made in Japan Sony TV, which was a matter of pride for the entire family, Second was the iconic Walkman, then the flat screen Sony Wega ( I remember being mesmerised by picture quality I saw at the store), Sony Xperia U, Sony SRS-ZR7 and the latest WH-1000XM3.I believe the quality of service is the weakest link for Sony in India and this experience would deter me to move ahead or recommend Sony products to my friends and family with confidence. Kindly take this feedback and reflect on what kind of feelings do you want to invoke when a person hears the name ""Sony"". Should it invoke the feeling confidence & high quality that arises from its Japanese origins or the brand with terrible service?Buyer Beware."

Simply Astounding - Exceeds Expectations",5.0,"Prior to purchasing this product, I was a tad skeptical as I did not want to pay almost 30K for a pair of headphones.However, on further research and after reading many reviews, I decided to go for it, and after finally getting it, I am convinced that it's worth it. Let me tell you why...I purchased the silver one - purely for aesthetic reasons.. it looks great when compared to the black one, which in my opinion is just too plain. Truth be told, it is not exactly silver, more of a mixture between cream white and grey.The headphones are made out of a very good quality plastic, the inner structure is metal, and the headphone earcups are made of a very soft and comfortable leather.I would recommend wiping off any sweat or perspiration that accumulates on the leather earcups because pure leather starts flaking over time when exposed to moisture, but it's nothing to worry about too much.Comfort - 10/10 - There are many reviews which say that the fit is tight and that it makes the ears sweat. This is not entirely true, which these headphones have a slightly tighter fit as compared to the Bose QC 35s, it is not uncomfortable at all. I found it a lot more comfortable in comparison to many other headphones I have used in the past.It's slight tightness is for a very good reason  - to seal the sound in. If you take the Bose QC35s, they have a looser fit and are more comfortable, but the sound bleeds very badly, and is often embarrassing because it would disturb people sitting around you, this is not a problem with the Sonys as the sound would not bleed unless you use it at the highest volume and even then, just a little sound can be heard by others.The leather earcups are extremely comfortable as well on ear, and their quality is just plush and pristine.Noise Cancellation - 10/10 - The noise cancellation on these headphones are supposed to be the #1 industry standard out there, and this is justified, because after testing it out, it does block out almost 80% of all surrounding ambient noise.This is leagues ahead of the Bose QC35 noise cancellation. The Bose's noise cancellation has a cabin pressure like feel, it gets uncomfortable after a while and gives you a mild headache and sometimes makes your ears pop - just like when you're sitting in a plane, these Sony headphones on the other hand, block out the noise so effectively and efficiently that you don't feel a thing.Sound quality - 10/10 - I'm speechless when it comes to the sound quality on this, it is simply astounding. I absolutely love how Sony allows you to customise the sound - based on YOUR preference. In other words if I want to listen to a song with good bass, all I have to do is enable bass boost sound settings on the app and I can enjoy amazing, trembling bass. On the other hand if I want to listen to a more vocal pop song, I can change the setting on the app and be treated to an amazing vocal performance. This whoops the Bose QC35's a** as Bose does not have any equaliser to change the sound settings. Basically with Bose - what you hear is what you get.Battery Backup - 10/10 - I kid you not, I listened to music for close to an hour, and when I checked the battery, it said 100%, not even kidding, dead serious. It easily gives you 30 + hours (with NC active), and perhaps more than 35 without.Touch controls - 9/10 - the touch controls are really amazing as well, but they require patience to learn and will take you a while to get accustomed to their usage, once you get a hang of it, they are really nice.In the box - one pair of headphones, one 6 inch usb C charging cable WITHOUT adapter and one headphone jack.I would recommend downloading the Sony Headphone Connect app while setting up these headphones for best results.You can use it without the app as well, but you're missing out on amazing sound personalisation and customisation if you choose not to get it.My final verdict - if you can afford it, go for it. Highly recommended!"

Premium Sound. Next level Product",4.0,"When you listen to music, not many people understand the finer elements of a composition. SONY WH-1000XM3 surprises us and gives a new premium feeling for the ears. This is almost 3 month after purchase reviewPROS -Sony really stands out when it comes to XM series. Talking about this device, it gives great comfort to ears. The cushions are very soft. I can wear it for almost 2 hrs straight. I have even taken naps also wearing this so build quality is pretty awesome. It got dropped accidentally but still no damages at all. It doesn’t fall out during workouts. It’s water resistant but not water proof so don’t drop it in the pool. It fits all heads and super easy to carry as these are not heavy at all. The overhead has very soft cushion.The sound is more towards bass if you turn the volume to full. You can feel vibration sensation when you are listening to some punchy music which itself was great feeling for me.Coming to ANC, it’s the king as compared to the products at this price segment. It can almost cut down the traffic noise . There are 3 modes of noise cancellation that can be set from the app. It can also detect your motion and set the ANC levels according to it .NFC is a cool feature , works only with android. Battery is pretty decent. It last about 10 hrs with ANC on and almost 20hrs with it off. Charging is pretty quick but make sure you don’t charge it with a big charger than 20w (don’t use any Oneplus chargers or the bigger adapters) . It has a fast charge. 3 hrs is the full charge time.CONS-The headphones and the case both needs to be cleaned otherwise the black matte finish model gets dirty. Not that pleasing for treble music lovers. It doesn’t have auto play/pause, which should have been provided for this price.Overall, this is a worth buying product. If you are someone who wants to step up and enjoy music , this is the stepping stone. Although it’s successors have some updates but one should purchase this product while entering in ANC world."

My honest review of XM3s and parallel with bose",5.0,"I pre ordered this from Amazon on the 12th of October and received the product on 22nd after launch on 18th. Others from normal orders received it before me. Don't ever trust Amazon with pre-orders, no one there knows what pre order ACTUALLY MEANS.On 24TH OCT (2 days later) I noticed a weird noise kinda faint static on the right ear cup when the ANC turned ON. Returned the defective one and got the replacement on 26th October. A lot of others have reported this issue. This is defect is on few devices. Think of it as a minor annoyance. But even with the defect I was excited each time I used it.Keep in mind that this noise is so faint that you have turn off music to be able to notice. For me it was on the right ear cup, but people have reported this noise from either of ear cups.Apart from XM3, I have both Sony XM2, BOSE QC 35 II. Xm3 hands down the best in NC Performance. The sound quality is great, it's bass heavy (compared to the 2 above) so I like to listen to XM3 more than bose, which sounds flat and doesn't get you immersed. For context: I listen to heavy metal and rock music. The customizer in the app is awesome. Sony just sounds better than bose, maybe partly also because of hi-res audio, more HD  Codec support like LDAC,  SBC ETC.Mic and phone call performance on M3s is on par with bose. Bose is better. But XM2s were worst. I take calls from noisy environments like co work space, open parking are zone with wind gushing, in cabs in bus, etc others never complained one single time about my voice being inaudible.When you open the device it comes with 100 percentage battery charged. Sony is great, come XM2 AND BOSE, comes with 70 percent. One weird this is if app is not connect and registered it the devise says low battery even though it's fully charged.So I typically use bose when I work at office as daily driver (as it also has multi device connectivity).M3s have come a long way on comfort, and now the only con with xm3 is that my ear sweats a lot, this doesn't happen with Bose quietcomfort. I like the love the gesture controls on M3 more than button on bose. I wish there was way to lock down touch to limit unintended touch triggers.Wrt to battery life is AWESOME. One really can't ask for more. There is no standby battery discharge, my observation over 5 days of no activity. The auto off does not work because any one device is always connected.On the build quality, I like bose better. Honestly, this is the only area I like bose better.Closing thoughts, Bose is my daily driver because it allows me to connect with Mac and phone same time. I can swap and connect calls easily. Also the sound signature isn't immersive, allows me to work even when the music is on. XM3s for me are the special ones, I use them for the special 'me' time. When I am looking to just enjoy music.PS. I am a developer / maker of Story Stream a platform to publish and stream immersive audio stories narrated by RJs and Voice artists. Story stream is live on Alex and coming soon on Google assistant devices. I use these headpphones for testing my apps ;) (if you have Alexa, you can enable Story Stream from the store)And that's the only reason why I have 3 expensive headphones. If I had to pick one, it's will be XM3 in a heart beat, even though it a good 15days old now, I get excited everytime I pick it up from the case to wear! Even though the bose is newer, I don't get as excited.If you have the budget, go for it. I can guarantee that you will be very excited about using it each time you put it on. This comes from some one who got a defective product, I swear even with the defective piece I was so excited about using it each time till the replacement arrived. Honestly Sony has done a tremendous job on XM3."

Better than ATH M50x, Sennheiser HD598 in noisy environments!",5.0,"I have Audio Technica ATH M50x and Sennheiser HD598 headphones that I've been using for the past 4 years. I also have Yamaha HS5 studio monitors. These are the baseline of comparison for me. I'd never wanted to buy another headphones for myself as I was already set with the two headphones (1 open back and 1 closed back) and a pair of excellent near field studio monitors for my recording deck. But one day my brother got these and was listening to them. I casually tried them on and was blown away by the noise cancellation prowess of these pair. And also was thoroughly impressed by the freedom wireless headphones offered. I was always of the opinion that wired headphone's sound quality could never be matched by a wireless headphones. It's true but these come pretty damn close!Things I absolutely love about the headphones are;1. Noise Cancellation is wonderful!. Whatever happens around you is barely audible as soon as you put these on. It may be weird at first but you get used to the active noise cancellation. And once the music starts playing, you're completely isolated in your own world. Nothing comes through once you put these on. I just totally love that about these headphones.2. Sound Quality: Now this is subjective. There are certain aspects of sound that I like in each of my headphones. On my M50x I like the analytical sound and I like that I can pick up anything and everything. But it gets a little too shrill and piercing because it's treble is too powerful and can be very very fatiguing. As for my HD598, being open back, they have good sound stage and they have the sennheiser veil. They are warm and almost flat. For laid back music listening they are wonderful and you can listen to them for 8 to 10 hours without any discomfort!. As for these, they are the best of both the worlds. The highs are clear and you can pick out the details in all the songs. The bass is wonderfully tight and strong. I've not seen such bass either in M50x or HD598. And I just love it. Even though I prefer the flat sound signature of HD598, I still like the slightly accentuated bass in these cans.3. The convenience: This was what pushed me to purchase. I can't believe how angry I got when every manufacturer in the world started removing the 3.5 mm Headphone jack. I wowed to never buy phones without headphone jack and also mentally became judgmental about wireless headphones. But after seeing my brother's Sony WH-1000XM3s I understood what I was missing out on. It's the convenience.... Not the sound quality or comfort or anything else that gets to you. I now use the headphones more often. So, essentially I'm getting more out of the money I spent on these. (And these are not cheap!). Battery life seems to be as advertised. I used these cans for almost 10 hours straight for the first 3 days and then had to charge them. These charge up in about half hour. Very nice feature.What I dislike....1. Comfort: I have large ears. Even though the cups are large enough that my big ears fit in them, they are not deep enough. After about an hour my ears start getting pinched and I have to adjust them or remove them for 1 or 2 minutes. Curiously enough, this only happens on the right earcup. Either my right earlobe is disproportionately large or the headphone cup is heavier on right side because of battery, because I've noticed that when you charge the headphones, the right earcup heats up. So either the charging circuit is there or the battery is. Whatever it might be, comfort is not as good as the sennheiser. I wouldn't even compare these with M50x on comfort because M50x suck at comfort! These are far better than M50x in comfort and a little worse than sennheiser HD598.2. Mids: As mentioned previously, I like flat sound signature, and these cans have recessed mids. The voices and instruments in the vocal range (like woodwinds) sound muted on these cans. Whereas on Sennheiser HD598 they are crystal clear. Perhaps my ears need to get used to the sound signature or have become accoustomed to flat sounding headphones. Whatever the case might be, mids are lower than bass and treble sounds in these cans. This doesn't take away from the musicality of the headphones though. The tracks sound wonderfully nice on these. You just need to turn up the volume to hear the voices (which in turn makes the instruments louder as well!) The male voices get muted a little. but female voices sound alright.In terms of sound quality considering my tastesSony WH-1000XM3 --- 8.8/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 9.6/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 9.4/10Yamaha HS5 --- 9.8/10 (you can hear everything in these :-)ComfortSony WH-1000XM3 --- 8.5/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 9/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 6/10Yamaha HS5 --- 10/10 (you don't need to wear them)Portability/Convenience. This should be your deciding factor to buy them or not.Sony WH-1000XM3 --- 10/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 7/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 7/10Yamaha HS5 --- 0/10 (these weigh 20 kgs and need wires and a sound card to run)Other considerations1. Call quality is decent over the phone but doesn't do well with Whatsapp video call or google hangouts or Cisco Webex (Yes I used these for meetings just to see how good the microphones were. It turns out that direct calls are fine but anything else and they fall apart).2. Controls: They are a little finicky. I'd have liked physical buttons that have a certainty to them. Here you're sometimes not sure if your action has been registered. Also when your fingers are sweaty, they don't slide as easily as you'd like them to. This causes noise due to finger dragging with friction over the control surface.Overall, I'd recommend this to everyone who wants to isolate themselves from the outside world. These are very good at that. But for pure sound quality or absolute comfort, I'd still recommend wired headphones like Sennheiser HD598. The problem with wireless headphones is that the technology (bluetooth) is still advancing and it might be 5 more years until it catches up to the quality of wired headphones. Then wireless headphones will fully take over the wired headphones market because only in sound quality department wireless headphones are lacking right now. The technology of wired headphones has come to its peak. There's nothing more to be done in that. The future is indeed wireless headphones with active noise cancellation. There's a lot to be done in this aspect. These technologies are still nascent. There's lot of scope of improvement in terms of pairing ease, bandwidth of bluetooth connection, battery life and noise cancellation algorithms.These are for people who travel a lot and need sound isolation to enjoy music. These are for people who like convenience over absolute sound quality. Bluetooth technology hasn't yet caught up with the wired headphone sound quality. But it will soon. These headphones are almost there.I wrote this review because no one has been comparing wireless headphones with wired ones. I hope it helps someone who is deciding to get a new phone that doesn't have a headphone jack. If you value absolute sound quality, don't get a phone without headphone jack. The wired headphones still offer better value and sound quality but at the expense of convenience."

Beats the competition",5.0,"Before I start with the review, let me make it clear that my tryst with noise cancellation headphones began in 2012 with the humble yet impressive Nokia BH-905 which I purchased for around 300 USD. My desire for good headphones started in the year 2008 with the wired Bose headphones and another Bose headphone a few years later. I am the proud owner of the Sennheiser PXC 550 for the past 3 years and have used it extensively to the extent that the leatherette coating has worn out beyond salvation.Although I do not claim myself to be an audiophile, I will do my best to review the Sony WH-1000XM3 to the best of my ability. This review will also compare the 1000 XM3 to the PXC 550.Packaging :-------------The headphones arrived in a decent box. The build quality of the box could be improved. The PXC 550 were packed in a much better built box. The product is made in Malaysia.Carrying case :-----------------The carrying case, although hard, is of average quality. The PXC 550 has a softer case in comparison. None of them come even closer to the immaculate carrying case which was provided with the Nokia BH-905 in 2012 !!!Build quality :----------------The 1000XM3 is pretty robust. I did not find much difference when compared to PXC 550. The main difference is that the earcups have a free sideways movement and no hard clicks. There could be confusion as to which one is left ear and which one is right. It will take some time to make peace with the fact that the left earcup has an NFC symbol on it.Ergonomics :---------------While I was used to the PXC 550 with all the buttons on its right side, the 1000 XM3 is in sharp contrast with the buttons on its left side. There is a multifunction button and a power button. The touch pad is located on the right side. There is a USB C charging port on the right side ( the updated PXC 550 still has a micro usb port )The head band is of decent quality and I did not face any trouble wearing the headphones.The earcups when compared to the PXC 550 are a tad uncomfortable to wear. While it is a known fact that around ear noise cancellation headphones will make your ears sweat after say, 2 hours of usage, I felt more comfortable with the PXC 550. Also the 1000 XM3 has an additional cushioning in front of the sound driver which is bound to  touch the ear pinna and cause you some irritation until such time that you get used to wearing the headphones.The headphones will definitely make your ears sweat. Period.So don't buy these headphones (or any around ear noise cancellation headphones for that matter ) to complain that the ears sweat !!!Noise cancellation :----------------------The 1000XM3 beats the competition upfront when it comes to noise cancellation. There is a feature to calibrate the noise cancellation and optimize it as per the situation, The multifunction button toggles between normal mode, ambience mode and noise cancellation mode. There is a feature where the noise cancellation levels can be adjusted for sitting, walking, running and transport. If ambient sound control is switched on, this feature will automatically adjust the noise cancellation levels as set by the user.Those who keep complaining about some ear pressure, please note that this is the basis on which noise cancellation works and hence there is bound to be some discomfort when noise cancellation is active. Take this from a person who has been regularly using noise cancelling headphones for the past 8 years.Sound quality :-----------------I never bothered to ponder over the sound quality when using the PXC 550 as I trusted a 30k headphone to sound well. But when I got my hands on the 1000 XM3, I did an upfront comparison between the two and I found out that the 1000 XM3 definitely sound better (by a small margin) than the PXC 550. Some rogue reviews mentioned that Sony has more bass than the others. I disagree with this statement. The 1000 XM3 has a punchier sound than the PXC 550 and hence one gets a feeling of more bass in comparison. On a lighter note, there is an option to increase bass levels using the software if the headphones aren't doing enough already !!!Connectivity :----------------Found no issues with connectivity. When compared to the PXC 550, the Bluetooth signal was just about the same strength, although the PXC 550 are a bit better. I tried out the headphones with a windows 10 laptop as well and found no issues. The headphones worked fine with my iPad air.The wired connection worked without any issues.The NFC function also worked fine.Touchpad :-------------The touch pad does a pretty decent job. But when I compare to the PXC 550, I felt that the 1000 XM3 has a slower response although it should not be much of a bother.On a positive note, there is a feature of lowering the music volume by just touching the touchpad with the palm. This feature is very useful when you want to listen to somebody without removing the headphones.Battery life :--------------The claimed battery life is 30 hours under test conditions. I did not bother to break my head over the number of hours I got with a single charge.Software :------------This is one factor where the 1000 XM3 outperform the PXC 550 by a big margin. The Sennheiser software was just a gimmick where the user could not do much than check the battery level of the headphones and a few other settings. The Sony software is very detailed with numerous settings and you can really control your headphones using the software. The headphone firmware was updated when I first connected them using the software. Beware that the update takes around 45 minutes to complete and you need to be patient.Conclusion :--------------For 19.3k during the Prime day sale, I am more than happy with these headphones. I did have an option to buy the updated PXC 550 or the Bose QC 35, but I chose to go ahead with Sony.One common issue with any premium headphone is the availability of replacement ear cushions and I still haven't been able to get one for my PXC 550. It is relatively easier to get one for the QC 35 and I hope that I don't have to beat around the bush much to get a replacement cushion for the 1000 XM3 in the near future."

Expensive but the way to go! my FIRST Noise Cancellation Headphones!",5.0,"This is my FIRST Noise Cancellation Headphones! So NOT AN Expert opinion :P-) Noise Cancellation is like using a tight In-Ear headphones But this is more comfortable-) This will block external noise like AC, FAN, Rain etc. Block means not 100% but 80 to 90%!-) If you play music! You will not hear anything from outside world! (As I said an In-Ear headphones do the same but it will be slightly painful)-) A tight In-Ear headphones are not a replacement for Built in Noise Cancellation! I just point it out to the people who never experienced a Noise Cancellation headphones in life. This Noise Cancellation is Another level. You will only believe it when you actually get a chance to use it. NO YouTube reviews will give you the real experience.This Noise Cancellation Headphones is useful WHEN- I watch youtube videos / tutorials- I write code- I brainstorming- I travel- I go to bed and hear some songs before sleep- I need to disconnect from the annoying world! around me :)Battery life is really good. USB-C means one less cable, Fast charging is good!, Touch control is awesome, if you put right hand to right ear cup you can come back to the world you are in. it is a huge plus, when mom are dad call me! all I need to do is put my hand on the right ear cup!Overall this NC Headphone Improved my life! Here is how.- Now I can focus more on my work- Less distraction from external noise (It is not 100% But 99% of the time it is 100%)- I hate travelling because of the the sounds and noise will influence my thoughts, I actually waste my time while travel because of that. yes a good In-Ear earphone can help but this is another level. So now I can actually do my stuff in my own world using this Noise Cancellation Headphones!Value?Yes -- if you have 30K to throw away. And it will not hurt your life in any way.No -- if you need to save money for next 12 Months to get this.Sound Quality?Base is there! If you are looking for that.But the nice thing is Sony's EQ can Adapt! That means anyone can change the Sound Aspects according to there needs from the Application. Out of the box it is perfect for my taste!If someone like less base you can change that through EQ.No product is perfect so in this Model what to improve?- Only once device can be connected at a time. (Minimum 2 devices is required now a days! [eg Laptop and SmartPhone])- User replaceable ear cup cushions!- Call Quality. This Headphones have an array of microphones but when when we call someone they will hear all Background Noise. I used it for some VOIP calls, It is usable but built in Microphones on your phone will do a much better job.- More and improved NC! Yes why not. There is always room for improvements.^^ I really don't know what to write as cons.I will Update this after using this for a week or two. bye.﻿"

Unique and awesome but can be improved!",5.0,"Reached before 12pm today on 19th. Awesome delivery service by Amazon and Appario retail.My first NC headphone and in fact  my first over the ear headphone .  Wanted a headphone with ANC so that i can hear good music even at very low volumes. This does achieve that to a large extent.Sound quality and isolation is good even without ANC turned on. What's really commendable is that the audio with the 3.5mm wired connection in the passive mode (i.e with the headphone switched off) was also quiet decent. Do note that with the wired connection you can still switch on the phone and  enable the ANC  but the app however  remains disabled .App works only when the Bluetooth is active .Found some issues  with the app. Since app is just a softwareI hope it would be updated soon  so not reducing any star . When we try to change mode from ""priority on sound quality"" to ""priority on stable connection"" and vice versa then the music stops and doesn't restart. If you want any equaliser changes these are possible only with ""priority on stable connection"". Further many times the app just forgets your last settings of Equalizer or surround sounds and just defaults to native options. Overall the app just doesn't appear premium like the headphones and is buggy. Seems the app development team was taking a nap while the hardware team was burning the midnight night oil. Comfort is good .Don't have any benchmark of BOSE so can't compare. Even tried to lie down with the headphones . Possible  if you use a pillow and want to lie sidewise. You cannot do it on regular basis but the intention was to try to see if it's possible occasionally. So I hope it should help in train journeys for masking loud snores of fellow passengers , khat-khat sound of train and getting good sleep.  When trying to do this test in my home I actually fell asleep :). The can fits into the pocket b/w pillow and the shoulder. Of course it's not a perfect fit ( like  you are not wearing your headphones at all )  but still it was possible by adjusting yourself.The touch controls do tend to get accidentally touched in this case,  say by your biceps or elbow . I hope in future updates Sony gets an option to disable/enable the touch, say by pressing both the power and the ANC button for some time.Touch controls do sometime tend to disobey you but still not a very big issue. The touch control  also responded when I tried to use a thick cloth but somehow  very not predictable.  Tried this to emulate the gloves in winters.The pad foam  do tend to get a little sweaty after around 2hrs and had to take the phones off for a few minutes . Currently the temperature is around 28deg. The phone pad foams should work very well for winters but it appears that in suumers they would tend to get warm and sweaty in case worn for long time. No comparison with Bose so can't compare relatively.ANC is good but for the first time users it does tend to create a in cabin pressure feeling. I however got accustomed to it in few hours. Thankfully there is an option to control the level of ANC.One thing I would like to mention about ANC . I tried testing the ANC with a 1500w mixer grinder and a 2000w vacuum cleaner as well. Don't assume it would mask the sound totally. I could still hear the whine if the motor very well. If you clap your hand you can still hear a thud  but all these sounds with the music on would be muted by 70-80 percent and  won't disturb you. This is just to align your expectations of the ANC. But ANC is still awesome and it would take some time to realise how awesome it is .  I was hearing coldplay at very low volumes with and without ANC , with the water tap on at full speed  ; the difference was phenomenal. And if you like cranked up volumes then of course the ANC would be even more effective.Battery is very good . Even after 3 hours of mixed  listening  on Bluetooth it was showing as 100percent. Sound quality is good and you can customise the equaliser for two of your own choices also . Bass can be tuned very well. I wish the settings got saved in the headphone rather than in the app.The music doesn't stop if you remove your headphones. Thats strange since this feature is present even in lower models like plantronics backbeat pro available,  at 11k.Regarding call quality,  I switched on the vaccum cleaner and made a call to the other party. They never complained about not hearing me. What I have found is that , unlike in some web  reviews, when making calls the ANC does remain active and the ambient noise doesn't  reach your ears or the other  person. May be the software has been tweaked since those reviews.  However it does appear as if you are talking with your ears covered by hand.  So you have  get to get used to that feeling . Overall found the call quality to be decent .If you have a balding head like me the phones tend to slip a bit :( which is just physics  . But hairy heads won't have this issue.Nevertheless I am enjoying it :)"

Recommended For Noise Cancellation",4.0,"I was a bit skeptical about buying this after reading about the static noise issues with either cups. The new version, XM4 were also revealed and available for pre-order elsewhere, and the reviews were very positive.Decided to buy these because:1. XM3 was available on sale and pricing was on par with sale prices in other parts of the world - and I could get it with Indian warranty (thought I need it after reading about the noise issues).2. XM3 is still quite good at noise cancellation when compared to XM4. XM4 would be probably launched in India around festive season (Sept-Nov) and would probably cost ~27k during sale. I didn't think I would need the improvements compared to what I save in price (9k). One would get improved sound quality due to the up-scaling chip, slightly better noise isolation, slightly more comfortable with the updated pads, play-pause music when headphone is worn-taken out, much improved mic (5 mic setup with ability to cancel cut some ambient sound) and finally support for multi-point connections (pair phone and laptop together and switch seamlessly).3. If I waited for XM4 prices to drop, rumors of XM5 with maybe a newer design will prompt one to wait even further. This is not going to end.So got these, tried them on for more than a week and here is what I think:1. If you don't need noise cancellation, then these aren't great value for the price. But if you need it, then you are looking at the one of the best. Cancels out most of the ambient sound (except voice - which you still can hear as muffled sounds - which can be masked by increasing volume a bit).2. Coming from wired headphones, these do feel heavy (these are one of the lightest noise cancelling headphones, so I wonder how comfortable the others are). But one does get used to it after a while.3. If you have never used a noise cancelling headphone in the past, ask around or visit a store to try this on. One may not like the feeling of wearing it, I for one didn't like it at all but then this is something you have to get used to when you are looking at noise cancellation. I think Bose is still more comfortable to wear.4. The bundled USB C cable is a jock. If you don't have a longer USB C cable, get one. You can use most chargers which lets you plug in a cable. Also comes with an airline adapter, good carrying case and an aux 3.5mm cable to use this wired (when battery is dead - without noise cancelling).5. Got a 1-2 months old import, made in Malaysia. So quite new, wonder why they were still making these (rumors of XM4 have been floating around for a long time, so I would have expected them to stop production).6. It supports lot of Codecs, so you don't have to worry about latency. But don't expect to game on this (connected to PC/PS4 via supplied cable), sounds quite weird with the bass rich sound profile (maybe I have to play with some setting to get it right).7. Sound quality is great for a Bluetooth headphone, but don't expect miracles if you have used decent wired or Bluetooth headphones. Much cheaper Bluetooth headphones can give you the same quality - but not coupled with similar noise isolation.8. The ear pads and padding in headband are comfortable. They are memory foam wrapped in synthetic leather. Downside is that they will get flaky after quite some time (even if you take good care of it, leave in a non-humid area). The manual has listed ear-pads as a replacement part available via authorized service center. I'm counting on that, if not, I'm sure parts will still be available from some part of the world since these sold quite well."

Sony service is the worst in the world. I have never come across such poor quality of service.",1.0,"The ProblemIt was about a few months ago that I started noticing a creaky noise from the right side of my WH-1000XM3 while listening to some audiobooks during a walk. At first, I ignored the noise as I thought it is due to my adjustments of the headband.I tried everything from removing my glasses to trying the tightest fit to get rid of the noise. To my disappointment, none of it worked.Visiting the service centre [4th July'20]I called in sony customer care who provided me with the phone no. of service centre near me. I reached out to ""iconnect"" in Gurgaon and tried describing my problem to him to which the response was that there is no need to explain to me the problem, just drive down to the service station. Surprised by the utter rudeness of attendant.I still followed the instructions and drove down to the service centre before 5 pm ( as I was instructed).I drove around 15 km to ""iconnect"" sony authorised service centre in Gurgaon. I patiently waited for my turn in an extremely warm service centre( The AC did not function). Interaction with the service centre employeeI started to describe the issue to an unengaged attendant who was still looking at his laptop screen.Me: I have been hearing squeaky noises from the right hinge of my headphones.He: ""Quiky"" without raising his head and continuing to look into his laptop.( As if the word was funny to him)Me: Excuse me!He: Yes, Sir.Me: The right side hinge makes noises even when the headphones are turned off. It is a workmanship defect.He: I haven't heard of such an issue ever.Me: But, it is an issue with my pair of headphones.He: We haven't been informed by Sony of any such issue.Meanwhile, my father started to record this interaction.To which the employee reacted aggressively that you can't record this. ( In an agitated tone)He said I won't serve you if you keep recording and left his counter.My father yielded and put his phone back into his pocket as we drove aa long way, the headphones were expensive and were going out of warranty in a few weeks.Finally, things moved forward, the service centre employee asked one of the technicians to look into the matter. We waited for another 40 mins. Meanwhile, the negative thoughts of getting my headphones messed up and with further damage crossed my mind as this place did not seem or operated professionally The Technician arrives with his analysis.The Technician: I have checked the circuitry and problem is not stemming from the electricals but is of mechanical in nature. I facepalmed myself and said to myself ""Exactly what I described, Why did you open my headphones""Next steps. The attendant spoke to a Sony employee and described him the problem over the phone & finally created a job sheet saying with the problem described as "" Abnormal noise from the right hinge even when the device is switched off""I asked him, what are the next steps, he said that he would let me know my Tuesday i.e 7th July'20 after he sends a video of this issue to the Sony Official. ( I am not too sure is the sound could be captured in a video effectively)Current status: I am patiently waiting for any update with the fear that I would be returned my old headphones which have now been open by not so professional service centre and might be prone to malfunction and since the warranty is near its end I might have to live with a product is further messed by the service centre.Update: 7th July 20The day I was promised that I would get to know what is the status of my service request.3 Sony call centre calls - Have committed me they have forwarded my concern to the service centre.5 calls to the service station- Either the some of the phones provided are always busy or out of service.I have no idea what is the status of my service request.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After calling the service centre for the 10th time they have finally replied that the headphones have been repaired and I can collect it. Which was informed to be non - repairable defect at the day of the first visit.The situation has gone bad to worse. Kindly help. I feel that I have been ripped off of my money by making this purchase decision. My request to SonyI have been a Sony customer & Fan for long, I remember our First coloured TV was a made in Japan Sony TV, which was a matter of pride for the entire family, Second was the iconic Walkman, then the flat screen Sony Wega ( I remember being mesmerised by picture quality I saw at the store), Sony Xperia U, Sony SRS-ZR7 and the latest WH-1000XM3.I believe the quality of service is the weakest link for Sony in India and this experience would deter me to move ahead or recommend Sony products to my friends and family with confidence. Kindly take this feedback and reflect on what kind of feelings do you want to invoke when a person hears the name ""Sony"". Should it invoke the feeling confidence & high quality that arises from its Japanese origins or the brand with terrible service?Buyer Beware."

Simply Astounding - Exceeds Expectations",5.0,"Prior to purchasing this product, I was a tad skeptical as I did not want to pay almost 30K for a pair of headphones.However, on further research and after reading many reviews, I decided to go for it, and after finally getting it, I am convinced that it's worth it. Let me tell you why...I purchased the silver one - purely for aesthetic reasons.. it looks great when compared to the black one, which in my opinion is just too plain. Truth be told, it is not exactly silver, more of a mixture between cream white and grey.The headphones are made out of a very good quality plastic, the inner structure is metal, and the headphone earcups are made of a very soft and comfortable leather.I would recommend wiping off any sweat or perspiration that accumulates on the leather earcups because pure leather starts flaking over time when exposed to moisture, but it's nothing to worry about too much.Comfort - 10/10 - There are many reviews which say that the fit is tight and that it makes the ears sweat. This is not entirely true, which these headphones have a slightly tighter fit as compared to the Bose QC 35s, it is not uncomfortable at all. I found it a lot more comfortable in comparison to many other headphones I have used in the past.It's slight tightness is for a very good reason  - to seal the sound in. If you take the Bose QC35s, they have a looser fit and are more comfortable, but the sound bleeds very badly, and is often embarrassing because it would disturb people sitting around you, this is not a problem with the Sonys as the sound would not bleed unless you use it at the highest volume and even then, just a little sound can be heard by others.The leather earcups are extremely comfortable as well on ear, and their quality is just plush and pristine.Noise Cancellation - 10/10 - The noise cancellation on these headphones are supposed to be the #1 industry standard out there, and this is justified, because after testing it out, it does block out almost 80% of all surrounding ambient noise.This is leagues ahead of the Bose QC35 noise cancellation. The Bose's noise cancellation has a cabin pressure like feel, it gets uncomfortable after a while and gives you a mild headache and sometimes makes your ears pop - just like when you're sitting in a plane, these Sony headphones on the other hand, block out the noise so effectively and efficiently that you don't feel a thing.Sound quality - 10/10 - I'm speechless when it comes to the sound quality on this, it is simply astounding. I absolutely love how Sony allows you to customise the sound - based on YOUR preference. In other words if I want to listen to a song with good bass, all I have to do is enable bass boost sound settings on the app and I can enjoy amazing, trembling bass. On the other hand if I want to listen to a more vocal pop song, I can change the setting on the app and be treated to an amazing vocal performance. This whoops the Bose QC35's a** as Bose does not have any equaliser to change the sound settings. Basically with Bose - what you hear is what you get.Battery Backup - 10/10 - I kid you not, I listened to music for close to an hour, and when I checked the battery, it said 100%, not even kidding, dead serious. It easily gives you 30 + hours (with NC active), and perhaps more than 35 without.Touch controls - 9/10 - the touch controls are really amazing as well, but they require patience to learn and will take you a while to get accustomed to their usage, once you get a hang of it, they are really nice.In the box - one pair of headphones, one 6 inch usb C charging cable WITHOUT adapter and one headphone jack.I would recommend downloading the Sony Headphone Connect app while setting up these headphones for best results.You can use it without the app as well, but you're missing out on amazing sound personalisation and customisation if you choose not to get it.My final verdict - if you can afford it, go for it. Highly recommended!"

Premium Sound. Next level Product",4.0,"When you listen to music, not many people understand the finer elements of a composition. SONY WH-1000XM3 surprises us and gives a new premium feeling for the ears. This is almost 3 month after purchase reviewPROS -Sony really stands out when it comes to XM series. Talking about this device, it gives great comfort to ears. The cushions are very soft. I can wear it for almost 2 hrs straight. I have even taken naps also wearing this so build quality is pretty awesome. It got dropped accidentally but still no damages at all. It doesn’t fall out during workouts. It’s water resistant but not water proof so don’t drop it in the pool. It fits all heads and super easy to carry as these are not heavy at all. The overhead has very soft cushion.The sound is more towards bass if you turn the volume to full. You can feel vibration sensation when you are listening to some punchy music which itself was great feeling for me.Coming to ANC, it’s the king as compared to the products at this price segment. It can almost cut down the traffic noise . There are 3 modes of noise cancellation that can be set from the app. It can also detect your motion and set the ANC levels according to it .NFC is a cool feature , works only with android. Battery is pretty decent. It last about 10 hrs with ANC on and almost 20hrs with it off. Charging is pretty quick but make sure you don’t charge it with a big charger than 20w (don’t use any Oneplus chargers or the bigger adapters) . It has a fast charge. 3 hrs is the full charge time.CONS-The headphones and the case both needs to be cleaned otherwise the black matte finish model gets dirty. Not that pleasing for treble music lovers. It doesn’t have auto play/pause, which should have been provided for this price.Overall, this is a worth buying product. If you are someone who wants to step up and enjoy music , this is the stepping stone. Although it’s successors have some updates but one should purchase this product while entering in ANC world."

My honest review of XM3s and parallel with bose",5.0,"I pre ordered this from Amazon on the 12th of October and received the product on 22nd after launch on 18th. Others from normal orders received it before me. Don't ever trust Amazon with pre-orders, no one there knows what pre order ACTUALLY MEANS.On 24TH OCT (2 days later) I noticed a weird noise kinda faint static on the right ear cup when the ANC turned ON. Returned the defective one and got the replacement on 26th October. A lot of others have reported this issue. This is defect is on few devices. Think of it as a minor annoyance. But even with the defect I was excited each time I used it.Keep in mind that this noise is so faint that you have turn off music to be able to notice. For me it was on the right ear cup, but people have reported this noise from either of ear cups.Apart from XM3, I have both Sony XM2, BOSE QC 35 II. Xm3 hands down the best in NC Performance. The sound quality is great, it's bass heavy (compared to the 2 above) so I like to listen to XM3 more than bose, which sounds flat and doesn't get you immersed. For context: I listen to heavy metal and rock music. The customizer in the app is awesome. Sony just sounds better than bose, maybe partly also because of hi-res audio, more HD  Codec support like LDAC,  SBC ETC.Mic and phone call performance on M3s is on par with bose. Bose is better. But XM2s were worst. I take calls from noisy environments like co work space, open parking are zone with wind gushing, in cabs in bus, etc others never complained one single time about my voice being inaudible.When you open the device it comes with 100 percentage battery charged. Sony is great, come XM2 AND BOSE, comes with 70 percent. One weird this is if app is not connect and registered it the devise says low battery even though it's fully charged.So I typically use bose when I work at office as daily driver (as it also has multi device connectivity).M3s have come a long way on comfort, and now the only con with xm3 is that my ear sweats a lot, this doesn't happen with Bose quietcomfort. I like the love the gesture controls on M3 more than button on bose. I wish there was way to lock down touch to limit unintended touch triggers.Wrt to battery life is AWESOME. One really can't ask for more. There is no standby battery discharge, my observation over 5 days of no activity. The auto off does not work because any one device is always connected.On the build quality, I like bose better. Honestly, this is the only area I like bose better.Closing thoughts, Bose is my daily driver because it allows me to connect with Mac and phone same time. I can swap and connect calls easily. Also the sound signature isn't immersive, allows me to work even when the music is on. XM3s for me are the special ones, I use them for the special 'me' time. When I am looking to just enjoy music.PS. I am a developer / maker of Story Stream a platform to publish and stream immersive audio stories narrated by RJs and Voice artists. Story stream is live on Alex and coming soon on Google assistant devices. I use these headpphones for testing my apps ;) (if you have Alexa, you can enable Story Stream from the store)And that's the only reason why I have 3 expensive headphones. If I had to pick one, it's will be XM3 in a heart beat, even though it a good 15days old now, I get excited everytime I pick it up from the case to wear! Even though the bose is newer, I don't get as excited.If you have the budget, go for it. I can guarantee that you will be very excited about using it each time you put it on. This comes from some one who got a defective product, I swear even with the defective piece I was so excited about using it each time till the replacement arrived. Honestly Sony has done a tremendous job on XM3."

Better than ATH M50x, Sennheiser HD598 in noisy environments!",5.0,"I have Audio Technica ATH M50x and Sennheiser HD598 headphones that I've been using for the past 4 years. I also have Yamaha HS5 studio monitors. These are the baseline of comparison for me. I'd never wanted to buy another headphones for myself as I was already set with the two headphones (1 open back and 1 closed back) and a pair of excellent near field studio monitors for my recording deck. But one day my brother got these and was listening to them. I casually tried them on and was blown away by the noise cancellation prowess of these pair. And also was thoroughly impressed by the freedom wireless headphones offered. I was always of the opinion that wired headphone's sound quality could never be matched by a wireless headphones. It's true but these come pretty damn close!Things I absolutely love about the headphones are;1. Noise Cancellation is wonderful!. Whatever happens around you is barely audible as soon as you put these on. It may be weird at first but you get used to the active noise cancellation. And once the music starts playing, you're completely isolated in your own world. Nothing comes through once you put these on. I just totally love that about these headphones.2. Sound Quality: Now this is subjective. There are certain aspects of sound that I like in each of my headphones. On my M50x I like the analytical sound and I like that I can pick up anything and everything. But it gets a little too shrill and piercing because it's treble is too powerful and can be very very fatiguing. As for my HD598, being open back, they have good sound stage and they have the sennheiser veil. They are warm and almost flat. For laid back music listening they are wonderful and you can listen to them for 8 to 10 hours without any discomfort!. As for these, they are the best of both the worlds. The highs are clear and you can pick out the details in all the songs. The bass is wonderfully tight and strong. I've not seen such bass either in M50x or HD598. And I just love it. Even though I prefer the flat sound signature of HD598, I still like the slightly accentuated bass in these cans.3. The convenience: This was what pushed me to purchase. I can't believe how angry I got when every manufacturer in the world started removing the 3.5 mm Headphone jack. I wowed to never buy phones without headphone jack and also mentally became judgmental about wireless headphones. But after seeing my brother's Sony WH-1000XM3s I understood what I was missing out on. It's the convenience.... Not the sound quality or comfort or anything else that gets to you. I now use the headphones more often. So, essentially I'm getting more out of the money I spent on these. (And these are not cheap!). Battery life seems to be as advertised. I used these cans for almost 10 hours straight for the first 3 days and then had to charge them. These charge up in about half hour. Very nice feature.What I dislike....1. Comfort: I have large ears. Even though the cups are large enough that my big ears fit in them, they are not deep enough. After about an hour my ears start getting pinched and I have to adjust them or remove them for 1 or 2 minutes. Curiously enough, this only happens on the right earcup. Either my right earlobe is disproportionately large or the headphone cup is heavier on right side because of battery, because I've noticed that when you charge the headphones, the right earcup heats up. So either the charging circuit is there or the battery is. Whatever it might be, comfort is not as good as the sennheiser. I wouldn't even compare these with M50x on comfort because M50x suck at comfort! These are far better than M50x in comfort and a little worse than sennheiser HD598.2. Mids: As mentioned previously, I like flat sound signature, and these cans have recessed mids. The voices and instruments in the vocal range (like woodwinds) sound muted on these cans. Whereas on Sennheiser HD598 they are crystal clear. Perhaps my ears need to get used to the sound signature or have become accoustomed to flat sounding headphones. Whatever the case might be, mids are lower than bass and treble sounds in these cans. This doesn't take away from the musicality of the headphones though. The tracks sound wonderfully nice on these. You just need to turn up the volume to hear the voices (which in turn makes the instruments louder as well!) The male voices get muted a little. but female voices sound alright.In terms of sound quality considering my tastesSony WH-1000XM3 --- 8.8/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 9.6/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 9.4/10Yamaha HS5 --- 9.8/10 (you can hear everything in these :-)ComfortSony WH-1000XM3 --- 8.5/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 9/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 6/10Yamaha HS5 --- 10/10 (you don't need to wear them)Portability/Convenience. This should be your deciding factor to buy them or not.Sony WH-1000XM3 --- 10/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 7/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 7/10Yamaha HS5 --- 0/10 (these weigh 20 kgs and need wires and a sound card to run)Other considerations1. Call quality is decent over the phone but doesn't do well with Whatsapp video call or google hangouts or Cisco Webex (Yes I used these for meetings just to see how good the microphones were. It turns out that direct calls are fine but anything else and they fall apart).2. Controls: They are a little finicky. I'd have liked physical buttons that have a certainty to them. Here you're sometimes not sure if your action has been registered. Also when your fingers are sweaty, they don't slide as easily as you'd like them to. This causes noise due to finger dragging with friction over the control surface.Overall, I'd recommend this to everyone who wants to isolate themselves from the outside world. These are very good at that. But for pure sound quality or absolute comfort, I'd still recommend wired headphones like Sennheiser HD598. The problem with wireless headphones is that the technology (bluetooth) is still advancing and it might be 5 more years until it catches up to the quality of wired headphones. Then wireless headphones will fully take over the wired headphones market because only in sound quality department wireless headphones are lacking right now. The technology of wired headphones has come to its peak. There's nothing more to be done in that. The future is indeed wireless headphones with active noise cancellation. There's a lot to be done in this aspect. These technologies are still nascent. There's lot of scope of improvement in terms of pairing ease, bandwidth of bluetooth connection, battery life and noise cancellation algorithms.These are for people who travel a lot and need sound isolation to enjoy music. These are for people who like convenience over absolute sound quality. Bluetooth technology hasn't yet caught up with the wired headphone sound quality. But it will soon. These headphones are almost there.I wrote this review because no one has been comparing wireless headphones with wired ones. I hope it helps someone who is deciding to get a new phone that doesn't have a headphone jack. If you value absolute sound quality, don't get a phone without headphone jack. The wired headphones still offer better value and sound quality but at the expense of convenience."

Beats the competition",5.0,"Before I start with the review, let me make it clear that my tryst with noise cancellation headphones began in 2012 with the humble yet impressive Nokia BH-905 which I purchased for around 300 USD. My desire for good headphones started in the year 2008 with the wired Bose headphones and another Bose headphone a few years later. I am the proud owner of the Sennheiser PXC 550 for the past 3 years and have used it extensively to the extent that the leatherette coating has worn out beyond salvation.Although I do not claim myself to be an audiophile, I will do my best to review the Sony WH-1000XM3 to the best of my ability. This review will also compare the 1000 XM3 to the PXC 550.Packaging :-------------The headphones arrived in a decent box. The build quality of the box could be improved. The PXC 550 were packed in a much better built box. The product is made in Malaysia.Carrying case :-----------------The carrying case, although hard, is of average quality. The PXC 550 has a softer case in comparison. None of them come even closer to the immaculate carrying case which was provided with the Nokia BH-905 in 2012 !!!Build quality :----------------The 1000XM3 is pretty robust. I did not find much difference when compared to PXC 550. The main difference is that the earcups have a free sideways movement and no hard clicks. There could be confusion as to which one is left ear and which one is right. It will take some time to make peace with the fact that the left earcup has an NFC symbol on it.Ergonomics :---------------While I was used to the PXC 550 with all the buttons on its right side, the 1000 XM3 is in sharp contrast with the buttons on its left side. There is a multifunction button and a power button. The touch pad is located on the right side. There is a USB C charging port on the right side ( the updated PXC 550 still has a micro usb port )The head band is of decent quality and I did not face any trouble wearing the headphones.The earcups when compared to the PXC 550 are a tad uncomfortable to wear. While it is a known fact that around ear noise cancellation headphones will make your ears sweat after say, 2 hours of usage, I felt more comfortable with the PXC 550. Also the 1000 XM3 has an additional cushioning in front of the sound driver which is bound to  touch the ear pinna and cause you some irritation until such time that you get used to wearing the headphones.The headphones will definitely make your ears sweat. Period.So don't buy these headphones (or any around ear noise cancellation headphones for that matter ) to complain that the ears sweat !!!Noise cancellation :----------------------The 1000XM3 beats the competition upfront when it comes to noise cancellation. There is a feature to calibrate the noise cancellation and optimize it as per the situation, The multifunction button toggles between normal mode, ambience mode and noise cancellation mode. There is a feature where the noise cancellation levels can be adjusted for sitting, walking, running and transport. If ambient sound control is switched on, this feature will automatically adjust the noise cancellation levels as set by the user.Those who keep complaining about some ear pressure, please note that this is the basis on which noise cancellation works and hence there is bound to be some discomfort when noise cancellation is active. Take this from a person who has been regularly using noise cancelling headphones for the past 8 years.Sound quality :-----------------I never bothered to ponder over the sound quality when using the PXC 550 as I trusted a 30k headphone to sound well. But when I got my hands on the 1000 XM3, I did an upfront comparison between the two and I found out that the 1000 XM3 definitely sound better (by a small margin) than the PXC 550. Some rogue reviews mentioned that Sony has more bass than the others. I disagree with this statement. The 1000 XM3 has a punchier sound than the PXC 550 and hence one gets a feeling of more bass in comparison. On a lighter note, there is an option to increase bass levels using the software if the headphones aren't doing enough already !!!Connectivity :----------------Found no issues with connectivity. When compared to the PXC 550, the Bluetooth signal was just about the same strength, although the PXC 550 are a bit better. I tried out the headphones with a windows 10 laptop as well and found no issues. The headphones worked fine with my iPad air.The wired connection worked without any issues.The NFC function also worked fine.Touchpad :-------------The touch pad does a pretty decent job. But when I compare to the PXC 550, I felt that the 1000 XM3 has a slower response although it should not be much of a bother.On a positive note, there is a feature of lowering the music volume by just touching the touchpad with the palm. This feature is very useful when you want to listen to somebody without removing the headphones.Battery life :--------------The claimed battery life is 30 hours under test conditions. I did not bother to break my head over the number of hours I got with a single charge.Software :------------This is one factor where the 1000 XM3 outperform the PXC 550 by a big margin. The Sennheiser software was just a gimmick where the user could not do much than check the battery level of the headphones and a few other settings. The Sony software is very detailed with numerous settings and you can really control your headphones using the software. The headphone firmware was updated when I first connected them using the software. Beware that the update takes around 45 minutes to complete and you need to be patient.Conclusion :--------------For 19.3k during the Prime day sale, I am more than happy with these headphones. I did have an option to buy the updated PXC 550 or the Bose QC 35, but I chose to go ahead with Sony.One common issue with any premium headphone is the availability of replacement ear cushions and I still haven't been able to get one for my PXC 550. It is relatively easier to get one for the QC 35 and I hope that I don't have to beat around the bush much to get a replacement cushion for the 1000 XM3 in the near future."

Expensive but the way to go! my FIRST Noise Cancellation Headphones!",5.0,"This is my FIRST Noise Cancellation Headphones! So NOT AN Expert opinion :P-) Noise Cancellation is like using a tight In-Ear headphones But this is more comfortable-) This will block external noise like AC, FAN, Rain etc. Block means not 100% but 80 to 90%!-) If you play music! You will not hear anything from outside world! (As I said an In-Ear headphones do the same but it will be slightly painful)-) A tight In-Ear headphones are not a replacement for Built in Noise Cancellation! I just point it out to the people who never experienced a Noise Cancellation headphones in life. This Noise Cancellation is Another level. You will only believe it when you actually get a chance to use it. NO YouTube reviews will give you the real experience.This Noise Cancellation Headphones is useful WHEN- I watch youtube videos / tutorials- I write code- I brainstorming- I travel- I go to bed and hear some songs before sleep- I need to disconnect from the annoying world! around me :)Battery life is really good. USB-C means one less cable, Fast charging is good!, Touch control is awesome, if you put right hand to right ear cup you can come back to the world you are in. it is a huge plus, when mom are dad call me! all I need to do is put my hand on the right ear cup!Overall this NC Headphone Improved my life! Here is how.- Now I can focus more on my work- Less distraction from external noise (It is not 100% But 99% of the time it is 100%)- I hate travelling because of the the sounds and noise will influence my thoughts, I actually waste my time while travel because of that. yes a good In-Ear earphone can help but this is another level. So now I can actually do my stuff in my own world using this Noise Cancellation Headphones!Value?Yes -- if you have 30K to throw away. And it will not hurt your life in any way.No -- if you need to save money for next 12 Months to get this.Sound Quality?Base is there! If you are looking for that.But the nice thing is Sony's EQ can Adapt! That means anyone can change the Sound Aspects according to there needs from the Application. Out of the box it is perfect for my taste!If someone like less base you can change that through EQ.No product is perfect so in this Model what to improve?- Only once device can be connected at a time. (Minimum 2 devices is required now a days! [eg Laptop and SmartPhone])- User replaceable ear cup cushions!- Call Quality. This Headphones have an array of microphones but when when we call someone they will hear all Background Noise. I used it for some VOIP calls, It is usable but built in Microphones on your phone will do a much better job.- More and improved NC! Yes why not. There is always room for improvements.^^ I really don't know what to write as cons.I will Update this after using this for a week or two. bye.﻿"

Unique and awesome but can be improved!",5.0,"Reached before 12pm today on 19th. Awesome delivery service by Amazon and Appario retail.My first NC headphone and in fact  my first over the ear headphone .  Wanted a headphone with ANC so that i can hear good music even at very low volumes. This does achieve that to a large extent.Sound quality and isolation is good even without ANC turned on. What's really commendable is that the audio with the 3.5mm wired connection in the passive mode (i.e with the headphone switched off) was also quiet decent. Do note that with the wired connection you can still switch on the phone and  enable the ANC  but the app however  remains disabled .App works only when the Bluetooth is active .Found some issues  with the app. Since app is just a softwareI hope it would be updated soon  so not reducing any star . When we try to change mode from ""priority on sound quality"" to ""priority on stable connection"" and vice versa then the music stops and doesn't restart. If you want any equaliser changes these are possible only with ""priority on stable connection"". Further many times the app just forgets your last settings of Equalizer or surround sounds and just defaults to native options. Overall the app just doesn't appear premium like the headphones and is buggy. Seems the app development team was taking a nap while the hardware team was burning the midnight night oil. Comfort is good .Don't have any benchmark of BOSE so can't compare. Even tried to lie down with the headphones . Possible  if you use a pillow and want to lie sidewise. You cannot do it on regular basis but the intention was to try to see if it's possible occasionally. So I hope it should help in train journeys for masking loud snores of fellow passengers , khat-khat sound of train and getting good sleep.  When trying to do this test in my home I actually fell asleep :). The can fits into the pocket b/w pillow and the shoulder. Of course it's not a perfect fit ( like  you are not wearing your headphones at all )  but still it was possible by adjusting yourself.The touch controls do tend to get accidentally touched in this case,  say by your biceps or elbow . I hope in future updates Sony gets an option to disable/enable the touch, say by pressing both the power and the ANC button for some time.Touch controls do sometime tend to disobey you but still not a very big issue. The touch control  also responded when I tried to use a thick cloth but somehow  very not predictable.  Tried this to emulate the gloves in winters.The pad foam  do tend to get a little sweaty after around 2hrs and had to take the phones off for a few minutes . Currently the temperature is around 28deg. The phone pad foams should work very well for winters but it appears that in suumers they would tend to get warm and sweaty in case worn for long time. No comparison with Bose so can't compare relatively.ANC is good but for the first time users it does tend to create a in cabin pressure feeling. I however got accustomed to it in few hours. Thankfully there is an option to control the level of ANC.One thing I would like to mention about ANC . I tried testing the ANC with a 1500w mixer grinder and a 2000w vacuum cleaner as well. Don't assume it would mask the sound totally. I could still hear the whine if the motor very well. If you clap your hand you can still hear a thud  but all these sounds with the music on would be muted by 70-80 percent and  won't disturb you. This is just to align your expectations of the ANC. But ANC is still awesome and it would take some time to realise how awesome it is .  I was hearing coldplay at very low volumes with and without ANC , with the water tap on at full speed  ; the difference was phenomenal. And if you like cranked up volumes then of course the ANC would be even more effective.Battery is very good . Even after 3 hours of mixed  listening  on Bluetooth it was showing as 100percent. Sound quality is good and you can customise the equaliser for two of your own choices also . Bass can be tuned very well. I wish the settings got saved in the headphone rather than in the app.The music doesn't stop if you remove your headphones. Thats strange since this feature is present even in lower models like plantronics backbeat pro available,  at 11k.Regarding call quality,  I switched on the vaccum cleaner and made a call to the other party. They never complained about not hearing me. What I have found is that , unlike in some web  reviews, when making calls the ANC does remain active and the ambient noise doesn't  reach your ears or the other  person. May be the software has been tweaked since those reviews.  However it does appear as if you are talking with your ears covered by hand.  So you have  get to get used to that feeling . Overall found the call quality to be decent .If you have a balding head like me the phones tend to slip a bit :( which is just physics  . But hairy heads won't have this issue.Nevertheless I am enjoying it :)"

Recommended For Noise Cancellation",4.0,"I was a bit skeptical about buying this after reading about the static noise issues with either cups. The new version, XM4 were also revealed and available for pre-order elsewhere, and the reviews were very positive.Decided to buy these because:1. XM3 was available on sale and pricing was on par with sale prices in other parts of the world - and I could get it with Indian warranty (thought I need it after reading about the noise issues).2. XM3 is still quite good at noise cancellation when compared to XM4. XM4 would be probably launched in India around festive season (Sept-Nov) and would probably cost ~27k during sale. I didn't think I would need the improvements compared to what I save in price (9k). One would get improved sound quality due to the up-scaling chip, slightly better noise isolation, slightly more comfortable with the updated pads, play-pause music when headphone is worn-taken out, much improved mic (5 mic setup with ability to cancel cut some ambient sound) and finally support for multi-point connections (pair phone and laptop together and switch seamlessly).3. If I waited for XM4 prices to drop, rumors of XM5 with maybe a newer design will prompt one to wait even further. This is not going to end.So got these, tried them on for more than a week and here is what I think:1. If you don't need noise cancellation, then these aren't great value for the price. But if you need it, then you are looking at the one of the best. Cancels out most of the ambient sound (except voice - which you still can hear as muffled sounds - which can be masked by increasing volume a bit).2. Coming from wired headphones, these do feel heavy (these are one of the lightest noise cancelling headphones, so I wonder how comfortable the others are). But one does get used to it after a while.3. If you have never used a noise cancelling headphone in the past, ask around or visit a store to try this on. One may not like the feeling of wearing it, I for one didn't like it at all but then this is something you have to get used to when you are looking at noise cancellation. I think Bose is still more comfortable to wear.4. The bundled USB C cable is a jock. If you don't have a longer USB C cable, get one. You can use most chargers which lets you plug in a cable. Also comes with an airline adapter, good carrying case and an aux 3.5mm cable to use this wired (when battery is dead - without noise cancelling).5. Got a 1-2 months old import, made in Malaysia. So quite new, wonder why they were still making these (rumors of XM4 have been floating around for a long time, so I would have expected them to stop production).6. It supports lot of Codecs, so you don't have to worry about latency. But don't expect to game on this (connected to PC/PS4 via supplied cable), sounds quite weird with the bass rich sound profile (maybe I have to play with some setting to get it right).7. Sound quality is great for a Bluetooth headphone, but don't expect miracles if you have used decent wired or Bluetooth headphones. Much cheaper Bluetooth headphones can give you the same quality - but not coupled with similar noise isolation.8. The ear pads and padding in headband are comfortable. They are memory foam wrapped in synthetic leather. Downside is that they will get flaky after quite some time (even if you take good care of it, leave in a non-humid area). The manual has listed ear-pads as a replacement part available via authorized service center. I'm counting on that, if not, I'm sure parts will still be available from some part of the world since these sold quite well."

Sony service is the worst in the world. I have never come across such poor quality of service.",1.0,"The ProblemIt was about a few months ago that I started noticing a creaky noise from the right side of my WH-1000XM3 while listening to some audiobooks during a walk. At first, I ignored the noise as I thought it is due to my adjustments of the headband.I tried everything from removing my glasses to trying the tightest fit to get rid of the noise. To my disappointment, none of it worked.Visiting the service centre [4th July'20]I called in sony customer care who provided me with the phone no. of service centre near me. I reached out to ""iconnect"" in Gurgaon and tried describing my problem to him to which the response was that there is no need to explain to me the problem, just drive down to the service station. Surprised by the utter rudeness of attendant.I still followed the instructions and drove down to the service centre before 5 pm ( as I was instructed).I drove around 15 km to ""iconnect"" sony authorised service centre in Gurgaon. I patiently waited for my turn in an extremely warm service centre( The AC did not function). Interaction with the service centre employeeI started to describe the issue to an unengaged attendant who was still looking at his laptop screen.Me: I have been hearing squeaky noises from the right hinge of my headphones.He: ""Quiky"" without raising his head and continuing to look into his laptop.( As if the word was funny to him)Me: Excuse me!He: Yes, Sir.Me: The right side hinge makes noises even when the headphones are turned off. It is a workmanship defect.He: I haven't heard of such an issue ever.Me: But, it is an issue with my pair of headphones.He: We haven't been informed by Sony of any such issue.Meanwhile, my father started to record this interaction.To which the employee reacted aggressively that you can't record this. ( In an agitated tone)He said I won't serve you if you keep recording and left his counter.My father yielded and put his phone back into his pocket as we drove aa long way, the headphones were expensive and were going out of warranty in a few weeks.Finally, things moved forward, the service centre employee asked one of the technicians to look into the matter. We waited for another 40 mins. Meanwhile, the negative thoughts of getting my headphones messed up and with further damage crossed my mind as this place did not seem or operated professionally The Technician arrives with his analysis.The Technician: I have checked the circuitry and problem is not stemming from the electricals but is of mechanical in nature. I facepalmed myself and said to myself ""Exactly what I described, Why did you open my headphones""Next steps. The attendant spoke to a Sony employee and described him the problem over the phone & finally created a job sheet saying with the problem described as "" Abnormal noise from the right hinge even when the device is switched off""I asked him, what are the next steps, he said that he would let me know my Tuesday i.e 7th July'20 after he sends a video of this issue to the Sony Official. ( I am not too sure is the sound could be captured in a video effectively)Current status: I am patiently waiting for any update with the fear that I would be returned my old headphones which have now been open by not so professional service centre and might be prone to malfunction and since the warranty is near its end I might have to live with a product is further messed by the service centre.Update: 7th July 20The day I was promised that I would get to know what is the status of my service request.3 Sony call centre calls - Have committed me they have forwarded my concern to the service centre.5 calls to the service station- Either the some of the phones provided are always busy or out of service.I have no idea what is the status of my service request.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After calling the service centre for the 10th time they have finally replied that the headphones have been repaired and I can collect it. Which was informed to be non - repairable defect at the day of the first visit.The situation has gone bad to worse. Kindly help. I feel that I have been ripped off of my money by making this purchase decision. My request to SonyI have been a Sony customer & Fan for long, I remember our First coloured TV was a made in Japan Sony TV, which was a matter of pride for the entire family, Second was the iconic Walkman, then the flat screen Sony Wega ( I remember being mesmerised by picture quality I saw at the store), Sony Xperia U, Sony SRS-ZR7 and the latest WH-1000XM3.I believe the quality of service is the weakest link for Sony in India and this experience would deter me to move ahead or recommend Sony products to my friends and family with confidence. Kindly take this feedback and reflect on what kind of feelings do you want to invoke when a person hears the name ""Sony"". Should it invoke the feeling confidence & high quality that arises from its Japanese origins or the brand with terrible service?Buyer Beware."

Simply Astounding - Exceeds Expectations",5.0,"Prior to purchasing this product, I was a tad skeptical as I did not want to pay almost 30K for a pair of headphones.However, on further research and after reading many reviews, I decided to go for it, and after finally getting it, I am convinced that it's worth it. Let me tell you why...I purchased the silver one - purely for aesthetic reasons.. it looks great when compared to the black one, which in my opinion is just too plain. Truth be told, it is not exactly silver, more of a mixture between cream white and grey.The headphones are made out of a very good quality plastic, the inner structure is metal, and the headphone earcups are made of a very soft and comfortable leather.I would recommend wiping off any sweat or perspiration that accumulates on the leather earcups because pure leather starts flaking over time when exposed to moisture, but it's nothing to worry about too much.Comfort - 10/10 - There are many reviews which say that the fit is tight and that it makes the ears sweat. This is not entirely true, which these headphones have a slightly tighter fit as compared to the Bose QC 35s, it is not uncomfortable at all. I found it a lot more comfortable in comparison to many other headphones I have used in the past.It's slight tightness is for a very good reason  - to seal the sound in. If you take the Bose QC35s, they have a looser fit and are more comfortable, but the sound bleeds very badly, and is often embarrassing because it would disturb people sitting around you, this is not a problem with the Sonys as the sound would not bleed unless you use it at the highest volume and even then, just a little sound can be heard by others.The leather earcups are extremely comfortable as well on ear, and their quality is just plush and pristine.Noise Cancellation - 10/10 - The noise cancellation on these headphones are supposed to be the #1 industry standard out there, and this is justified, because after testing it out, it does block out almost 80% of all surrounding ambient noise.This is leagues ahead of the Bose QC35 noise cancellation. The Bose's noise cancellation has a cabin pressure like feel, it gets uncomfortable after a while and gives you a mild headache and sometimes makes your ears pop - just like when you're sitting in a plane, these Sony headphones on the other hand, block out the noise so effectively and efficiently that you don't feel a thing.Sound quality - 10/10 - I'm speechless when it comes to the sound quality on this, it is simply astounding. I absolutely love how Sony allows you to customise the sound - based on YOUR preference. In other words if I want to listen to a song with good bass, all I have to do is enable bass boost sound settings on the app and I can enjoy amazing, trembling bass. On the other hand if I want to listen to a more vocal pop song, I can change the setting on the app and be treated to an amazing vocal performance. This whoops the Bose QC35's a** as Bose does not have any equaliser to change the sound settings. Basically with Bose - what you hear is what you get.Battery Backup - 10/10 - I kid you not, I listened to music for close to an hour, and when I checked the battery, it said 100%, not even kidding, dead serious. It easily gives you 30 + hours (with NC active), and perhaps more than 35 without.Touch controls - 9/10 - the touch controls are really amazing as well, but they require patience to learn and will take you a while to get accustomed to their usage, once you get a hang of it, they are really nice.In the box - one pair of headphones, one 6 inch usb C charging cable WITHOUT adapter and one headphone jack.I would recommend downloading the Sony Headphone Connect app while setting up these headphones for best results.You can use it without the app as well, but you're missing out on amazing sound personalisation and customisation if you choose not to get it.My final verdict - if you can afford it, go for it. Highly recommended!"

Premium Sound. Next level Product",4.0,"When you listen to music, not many people understand the finer elements of a composition. SONY WH-1000XM3 surprises us and gives a new premium feeling for the ears. This is almost 3 month after purchase reviewPROS -Sony really stands out when it comes to XM series. Talking about this device, it gives great comfort to ears. The cushions are very soft. I can wear it for almost 2 hrs straight. I have even taken naps also wearing this so build quality is pretty awesome. It got dropped accidentally but still no damages at all. It doesn’t fall out during workouts. It’s water resistant but not water proof so don’t drop it in the pool. It fits all heads and super easy to carry as these are not heavy at all. The overhead has very soft cushion.The sound is more towards bass if you turn the volume to full. You can feel vibration sensation when you are listening to some punchy music which itself was great feeling for me.Coming to ANC, it’s the king as compared to the products at this price segment. It can almost cut down the traffic noise . There are 3 modes of noise cancellation that can be set from the app. It can also detect your motion and set the ANC levels according to it .NFC is a cool feature , works only with android. Battery is pretty decent. It last about 10 hrs with ANC on and almost 20hrs with it off. Charging is pretty quick but make sure you don’t charge it with a big charger than 20w (don’t use any Oneplus chargers or the bigger adapters) . It has a fast charge. 3 hrs is the full charge time.CONS-The headphones and the case both needs to be cleaned otherwise the black matte finish model gets dirty. Not that pleasing for treble music lovers. It doesn’t have auto play/pause, which should have been provided for this price.Overall, this is a worth buying product. If you are someone who wants to step up and enjoy music , this is the stepping stone. Although it’s successors have some updates but one should purchase this product while entering in ANC world."

My honest review of XM3s and parallel with bose",5.0,"I pre ordered this from Amazon on the 12th of October and received the product on 22nd after launch on 18th. Others from normal orders received it before me. Don't ever trust Amazon with pre-orders, no one there knows what pre order ACTUALLY MEANS.On 24TH OCT (2 days later) I noticed a weird noise kinda faint static on the right ear cup when the ANC turned ON. Returned the defective one and got the replacement on 26th October. A lot of others have reported this issue. This is defect is on few devices. Think of it as a minor annoyance. But even with the defect I was excited each time I used it.Keep in mind that this noise is so faint that you have turn off music to be able to notice. For me it was on the right ear cup, but people have reported this noise from either of ear cups.Apart from XM3, I have both Sony XM2, BOSE QC 35 II. Xm3 hands down the best in NC Performance. The sound quality is great, it's bass heavy (compared to the 2 above) so I like to listen to XM3 more than bose, which sounds flat and doesn't get you immersed. For context: I listen to heavy metal and rock music. The customizer in the app is awesome. Sony just sounds better than bose, maybe partly also because of hi-res audio, more HD  Codec support like LDAC,  SBC ETC.Mic and phone call performance on M3s is on par with bose. Bose is better. But XM2s were worst. I take calls from noisy environments like co work space, open parking are zone with wind gushing, in cabs in bus, etc others never complained one single time about my voice being inaudible.When you open the device it comes with 100 percentage battery charged. Sony is great, come XM2 AND BOSE, comes with 70 percent. One weird this is if app is not connect and registered it the devise says low battery even though it's fully charged.So I typically use bose when I work at office as daily driver (as it also has multi device connectivity).M3s have come a long way on comfort, and now the only con with xm3 is that my ear sweats a lot, this doesn't happen with Bose quietcomfort. I like the love the gesture controls on M3 more than button on bose. I wish there was way to lock down touch to limit unintended touch triggers.Wrt to battery life is AWESOME. One really can't ask for more. There is no standby battery discharge, my observation over 5 days of no activity. The auto off does not work because any one device is always connected.On the build quality, I like bose better. Honestly, this is the only area I like bose better.Closing thoughts, Bose is my daily driver because it allows me to connect with Mac and phone same time. I can swap and connect calls easily. Also the sound signature isn't immersive, allows me to work even when the music is on. XM3s for me are the special ones, I use them for the special 'me' time. When I am looking to just enjoy music.PS. I am a developer / maker of Story Stream a platform to publish and stream immersive audio stories narrated by RJs and Voice artists. Story stream is live on Alex and coming soon on Google assistant devices. I use these headpphones for testing my apps ;) (if you have Alexa, you can enable Story Stream from the store)And that's the only reason why I have 3 expensive headphones. If I had to pick one, it's will be XM3 in a heart beat, even though it a good 15days old now, I get excited everytime I pick it up from the case to wear! Even though the bose is newer, I don't get as excited.If you have the budget, go for it. I can guarantee that you will be very excited about using it each time you put it on. This comes from some one who got a defective product, I swear even with the defective piece I was so excited about using it each time till the replacement arrived. Honestly Sony has done a tremendous job on XM3."

Better than ATH M50x, Sennheiser HD598 in noisy environments!",5.0,"I have Audio Technica ATH M50x and Sennheiser HD598 headphones that I've been using for the past 4 years. I also have Yamaha HS5 studio monitors. These are the baseline of comparison for me. I'd never wanted to buy another headphones for myself as I was already set with the two headphones (1 open back and 1 closed back) and a pair of excellent near field studio monitors for my recording deck. But one day my brother got these and was listening to them. I casually tried them on and was blown away by the noise cancellation prowess of these pair. And also was thoroughly impressed by the freedom wireless headphones offered. I was always of the opinion that wired headphone's sound quality could never be matched by a wireless headphones. It's true but these come pretty damn close!Things I absolutely love about the headphones are;1. Noise Cancellation is wonderful!. Whatever happens around you is barely audible as soon as you put these on. It may be weird at first but you get used to the active noise cancellation. And once the music starts playing, you're completely isolated in your own world. Nothing comes through once you put these on. I just totally love that about these headphones.2. Sound Quality: Now this is subjective. There are certain aspects of sound that I like in each of my headphones. On my M50x I like the analytical sound and I like that I can pick up anything and everything. But it gets a little too shrill and piercing because it's treble is too powerful and can be very very fatiguing. As for my HD598, being open back, they have good sound stage and they have the sennheiser veil. They are warm and almost flat. For laid back music listening they are wonderful and you can listen to them for 8 to 10 hours without any discomfort!. As for these, they are the best of both the worlds. The highs are clear and you can pick out the details in all the songs. The bass is wonderfully tight and strong. I've not seen such bass either in M50x or HD598. And I just love it. Even though I prefer the flat sound signature of HD598, I still like the slightly accentuated bass in these cans.3. The convenience: This was what pushed me to purchase. I can't believe how angry I got when every manufacturer in the world started removing the 3.5 mm Headphone jack. I wowed to never buy phones without headphone jack and also mentally became judgmental about wireless headphones. But after seeing my brother's Sony WH-1000XM3s I understood what I was missing out on. It's the convenience.... Not the sound quality or comfort or anything else that gets to you. I now use the headphones more often. So, essentially I'm getting more out of the money I spent on these. (And these are not cheap!). Battery life seems to be as advertised. I used these cans for almost 10 hours straight for the first 3 days and then had to charge them. These charge up in about half hour. Very nice feature.What I dislike....1. Comfort: I have large ears. Even though the cups are large enough that my big ears fit in them, they are not deep enough. After about an hour my ears start getting pinched and I have to adjust them or remove them for 1 or 2 minutes. Curiously enough, this only happens on the right earcup. Either my right earlobe is disproportionately large or the headphone cup is heavier on right side because of battery, because I've noticed that when you charge the headphones, the right earcup heats up. So either the charging circuit is there or the battery is. Whatever it might be, comfort is not as good as the sennheiser. I wouldn't even compare these with M50x on comfort because M50x suck at comfort! These are far better than M50x in comfort and a little worse than sennheiser HD598.2. Mids: As mentioned previously, I like flat sound signature, and these cans have recessed mids. The voices and instruments in the vocal range (like woodwinds) sound muted on these cans. Whereas on Sennheiser HD598 they are crystal clear. Perhaps my ears need to get used to the sound signature or have become accoustomed to flat sounding headphones. Whatever the case might be, mids are lower than bass and treble sounds in these cans. This doesn't take away from the musicality of the headphones though. The tracks sound wonderfully nice on these. You just need to turn up the volume to hear the voices (which in turn makes the instruments louder as well!) The male voices get muted a little. but female voices sound alright.In terms of sound quality considering my tastesSony WH-1000XM3 --- 8.8/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 9.6/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 9.4/10Yamaha HS5 --- 9.8/10 (you can hear everything in these :-)ComfortSony WH-1000XM3 --- 8.5/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 9/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 6/10Yamaha HS5 --- 10/10 (you don't need to wear them)Portability/Convenience. This should be your deciding factor to buy them or not.Sony WH-1000XM3 --- 10/10Sennheiser HD598 --- 7/10Audio Technica ATH M50x --- 7/10Yamaha HS5 --- 0/10 (these weigh 20 kgs and need wires and a sound card to run)Other considerations1. Call quality is decent over the phone but doesn't do well with Whatsapp video call or google hangouts or Cisco Webex (Yes I used these for meetings just to see how good the microphones were. It turns out that direct calls are fine but anything else and they fall apart).2. Controls: They are a little finicky. I'd have liked physical buttons that have a certainty to them. Here you're sometimes not sure if your action has been registered. Also when your fingers are sweaty, they don't slide as easily as you'd like them to. This causes noise due to finger dragging with friction over the control surface.Overall, I'd recommend this to everyone who wants to isolate themselves from the outside world. These are very good at that. But for pure sound quality or absolute comfort, I'd still recommend wired headphones like Sennheiser HD598. The problem with wireless headphones is that the technology (bluetooth) is still advancing and it might be 5 more years until it catches up to the quality of wired headphones. Then wireless headphones will fully take over the wired headphones market because only in sound quality department wireless headphones are lacking right now. The technology of wired headphones has come to its peak. There's nothing more to be done in that. The future is indeed wireless headphones with active noise cancellation. There's a lot to be done in this aspect. These technologies are still nascent. There's lot of scope of improvement in terms of pairing ease, bandwidth of bluetooth connection, battery life and noise cancellation algorithms.These are for people who travel a lot and need sound isolation to enjoy music. These are for people who like convenience over absolute sound quality. Bluetooth technology hasn't yet caught up with the wired headphone sound quality. But it will soon. These headphones are almost there.I wrote this review because no one has been comparing wireless headphones with wired ones. I hope it helps someone who is deciding to get a new phone that doesn't have a headphone jack. If you value absolute sound quality, don't get a phone without headphone jack. The wired headphones still offer better value and sound quality but at the expense of convenience."

Beats the competition",5.0,"Before I start with the review, let me make it clear that my tryst with noise cancellation headphones began in 2012 with the humble yet impressive Nokia BH-905 which I purchased for around 300 USD. My desire for good headphones started in the year 2008 with the wired Bose headphones and another Bose headphone a few years later. I am the proud owner of the Sennheiser PXC 550 for the past 3 years and have used it extensively to the extent that the leatherette coating has worn out beyond salvation.Although I do not claim myself to be an audiophile, I will do my best to review the Sony WH-1000XM3 to the best of my ability. This review will also compare the 1000 XM3 to the PXC 550.Packaging :-------------The headphones arrived in a decent box. The build quality of the box could be improved. The PXC 550 were packed in a much better built box. The product is made in Malaysia.Carrying case :-----------------The carrying case, although hard, is of average quality. The PXC 550 has a softer case in comparison. None of them come even closer to the immaculate carrying case which was provided with the Nokia BH-905 in 2012 !!!Build quality :----------------The 1000XM3 is pretty robust. I did not find much difference when compared to PXC 550. The main difference is that the earcups have a free sideways movement and no hard clicks. There could be confusion as to which one is left ear and which one is right. It will take some time to make peace with the fact that the left earcup has an NFC symbol on it.Ergonomics :---------------While I was used to the PXC 550 with all the buttons on its right side, the 1000 XM3 is in sharp contrast with the buttons on its left side. There is a multifunction button and a power button. The touch pad is located on the right side. There is a USB C charging port on the right side ( the updated PXC 550 still has a micro usb port )The head band is of decent quality and I did not face any trouble wearing the headphones.The earcups when compared to the PXC 550 are a tad uncomfortable to wear. While it is a known fact that around ear noise cancellation headphones will make your ears sweat after say, 2 hours of usage, I felt more comfortable with the PXC 550. Also the 1000 XM3 has an additional cushioning in front of the sound driver which is bound to  touch the ear pinna and cause you some irritation until such time that you get used to wearing the headphones.The headphones will definitely make your ears sweat. Period.So don't buy these headphones (or any around ear noise cancellation headphones for that matter ) to complain that the ears sweat !!!Noise cancellation :----------------------The 1000XM3 beats the competition upfront when it comes to noise cancellation. There is a feature to calibrate the noise cancellation and optimize it as per the situation, The multifunction button toggles between normal mode, ambience mode and noise cancellation mode. There is a feature where the noise cancellation levels can be adjusted for sitting, walking, running and transport. If ambient sound control is switched on, this feature will automatically adjust the noise cancellation levels as set by the user.Those who keep complaining about some ear pressure, please note that this is the basis on which noise cancellation works and hence there is bound to be some discomfort when noise cancellation is active. Take this from a person who has been regularly using noise cancelling headphones for the past 8 years.Sound quality :-----------------I never bothered to ponder over the sound quality when using the PXC 550 as I trusted a 30k headphone to sound well. But when I got my hands on the 1000 XM3, I did an upfront comparison between the two and I found out that the 1000 XM3 definitely sound better (by a small margin) than the PXC 550. Some rogue reviews mentioned that Sony has more bass than the others. I disagree with this statement. The 1000 XM3 has a punchier sound than the PXC 550 and hence one gets a feeling of more bass in comparison. On a lighter note, there is an option to increase bass levels using the software if the headphones aren't doing enough already !!!Connectivity :----------------Found no issues with connectivity. When compared to the PXC 550, the Bluetooth signal was just about the same strength, although the PXC 550 are a bit better. I tried out the headphones with a windows 10 laptop as well and found no issues. The headphones worked fine with my iPad air.The wired connection worked without any issues.The NFC function also worked fine.Touchpad :-------------The touch pad does a pretty decent job. But when I compare to the PXC 550, I felt that the 1000 XM3 has a slower response although it should not be much of a bother.On a positive note, there is a feature of lowering the music volume by just touching the touchpad with the palm. This feature is very useful when you want to listen to somebody without removing the headphones.Battery life :--------------The claimed battery life is 30 hours under test conditions. I did not bother to break my head over the number of hours I got with a single charge.Software :------------This is one factor where the 1000 XM3 outperform the PXC 550 by a big margin. The Sennheiser software was just a gimmick where the user could not do much than check the battery level of the headphones and a few other settings. The Sony software is very detailed with numerous settings and you can really control your headphones using the software. The headphone firmware was updated when I first connected them using the software. Beware that the update takes around 45 minutes to complete and you need to be patient.Conclusion :--------------For 19.3k during the Prime day sale, I am more than happy with these headphones. I did have an option to buy the updated PXC 550 or the Bose QC 35, but I chose to go ahead with Sony.One common issue with any premium headphone is the availability of replacement ear cushions and I still haven't been able to get one for my PXC 550. It is relatively easier to get one for the QC 35 and I hope that I don't have to beat around the bush much to get a replacement cushion for the 1000 XM3 in the near future."

Expensive but the way to go! my FIRST Noise Cancellation Headphones!",5.0,"This is my FIRST Noise Cancellation Headphones! So NOT AN Expert opinion :P-) Noise Cancellation is like using a tight In-Ear headphones But this is more comfortable-) This will block external noise like AC, FAN, Rain etc. Block means not 100% but 80 to 90%!-) If you play music! You will not hear anything from outside world! (As I said an In-Ear headphones do the same but it will be slightly painful)-) A tight In-Ear headphones are not a replacement for Built in Noise Cancellation! I just point it out to the people who never experienced a Noise Cancellation headphones in life. This Noise Cancellation is Another level. You will only believe it when you actually get a chance to use it. NO YouTube reviews will give you the real experience.This Noise Cancellation Headphones is useful WHEN- I watch youtube videos / tutorials- I write code- I brainstorming- I travel- I go to bed and hear some songs before sleep- I need to disconnect from the annoying world! around me :)Battery life is really good. USB-C means one less cable, Fast charging is good!, Touch control is awesome, if you put right hand to right ear cup you can come back to the world you are in. it is a huge plus, when mom are dad call me! all I need to do is put my hand on the right ear cup!Overall this NC Headphone Improved my life! Here is how.- Now I can focus more on my work- Less distraction from external noise (It is not 100% But 99% of the time it is 100%)- I hate travelling because of the the sounds and noise will influence my thoughts, I actually waste my time while travel because of that. yes a good In-Ear earphone can help but this is another level. So now I can actually do my stuff in my own world using this Noise Cancellation Headphones!Value?Yes -- if you have 30K to throw away. And it will not hurt your life in any way.No -- if you need to save money for next 12 Months to get this.Sound Quality?Base is there! If you are looking for that.But the nice thing is Sony's EQ can Adapt! That means anyone can change the Sound Aspects according to there needs from the Application. Out of the box it is perfect for my taste!If someone like less base you can change that through EQ.No product is perfect so in this Model what to improve?- Only once device can be connected at a time. (Minimum 2 devices is required now a days! [eg Laptop and SmartPhone])- User replaceable ear cup cushions!- Call Quality. This Headphones have an array of microphones but when when we call someone they will hear all Background Noise. I used it for some VOIP calls, It is usable but built in Microphones on your phone will do a much better job.- More and improved NC! Yes why not. There is always room for improvements.^^ I really don't know what to write as cons.I will Update this after using this for a week or two. bye.﻿"

Unique and awesome but can be improved!",5.0,"Reached before 12pm today on 19th. Awesome delivery service by Amazon and Appario retail.My first NC headphone and in fact  my first over the ear headphone .  Wanted a headphone with ANC so that i can hear good music even at very low volumes. This does achieve that to a large extent.Sound quality and isolation is good even without ANC turned on. What's really commendable is that the audio with the 3.5mm wired connection in the passive mode (i.e with the headphone switched off) was also quiet decent. Do note that with the wired connection you can still switch on the phone and  enable the ANC  but the app however  remains disabled .App works only when the Bluetooth is active .Found some issues  with the app. Since app is just a softwareI hope it would be updated soon  so not reducing any star . When we try to change mode from ""priority on sound quality"" to ""priority on stable connection"" and vice versa then the music stops and doesn't restart. If you want any equaliser changes these are possible only with ""priority on stable connection"". Further many times the app just forgets your last settings of Equalizer or surround sounds and just defaults to native options. Overall the app just doesn't appear premium like the headphones and is buggy. Seems the app development team was taking a nap while the hardware team was burning the midnight night oil. Comfort is good .Don't have any benchmark of BOSE so can't compare. Even tried to lie down with the headphones . Possible  if you use a pillow and want to lie sidewise. You cannot do it on regular basis but the intention was to try to see if it's possible occasionally. So I hope it should help in train journeys for masking loud snores of fellow passengers , khat-khat sound of train and getting good sleep.  When trying to do this test in my home I actually fell asleep :). The can fits into the pocket b/w pillow and the shoulder. Of course it's not a perfect fit ( like  you are not wearing your headphones at all )  but still it was possible by adjusting yourself.The touch controls do tend to get accidentally touched in this case,  say by your biceps or elbow . I hope in future updates Sony gets an option to disable/enable the touch, say by pressing both the power and the ANC button for some time.Touch controls do sometime tend to disobey you but still not a very big issue. The touch control  also responded when I tried to use a thick cloth but somehow  very not predictable.  Tried this to emulate the gloves in winters.The pad foam  do tend to get a little sweaty after around 2hrs and had to take the phones off for a few minutes . Currently the temperature is around 28deg. The phone pad foams should work very well for winters but it appears that in suumers they would tend to get warm and sweaty in case worn for long time. No comparison with Bose so can't compare relatively.ANC is good but for the first time users it does tend to create a in cabin pressure feeling. I however got accustomed to it in few hours. Thankfully there is an option to control the level of ANC.One thing I would like to mention about ANC . I tried testing the ANC with a 1500w mixer grinder and a 2000w vacuum cleaner as well. Don't assume it would mask the sound totally. I could still hear the whine if the motor very well. If you clap your hand you can still hear a thud  but all these sounds with the music on would be muted by 70-80 percent and  won't disturb you. This is just to align your expectations of the ANC. But ANC is still awesome and it would take some time to realise how awesome it is .  I was hearing coldplay at very low volumes with and without ANC , with the water tap on at full speed  ; the difference was phenomenal. And if you like cranked up volumes then of course the ANC would be even more effective.Battery is very good . Even after 3 hours of mixed  listening  on Bluetooth it was showing as 100percent. Sound quality is good and you can customise the equaliser for two of your own choices also . Bass can be tuned very well. I wish the settings got saved in the headphone rather than in the app.The music doesn't stop if you remove your headphones. Thats strange since this feature is present even in lower models like plantronics backbeat pro available,  at 11k.Regarding call quality,  I switched on the vaccum cleaner and made a call to the other party. They never complained about not hearing me. What I have found is that , unlike in some web  reviews, when making calls the ANC does remain active and the ambient noise doesn't  reach your ears or the other  person. May be the software has been tweaked since those reviews.  However it does appear as if you are talking with your ears covered by hand.  So you have  get to get used to that feeling . Overall found the call quality to be decent .If you have a balding head like me the phones tend to slip a bit :( which is just physics  . But hairy heads won't have this issue.Nevertheless I am enjoying it :)"

Recommended For Noise Cancellation",4.0,"I was a bit skeptical about buying this after reading about the static noise issues with either cups. The new version, XM4 were also revealed and available for pre-order elsewhere, and the reviews were very positive.Decided to buy these because:1. XM3 was available on sale and pricing was on par with sale prices in other parts of the world - and I could get it with Indian warranty (thought I need it after reading about the noise issues).2. XM3 is still quite good at noise cancellation when compared to XM4. XM4 would be probably launched in India around festive season (Sept-Nov) and would probably cost ~27k during sale. I didn't think I would need the improvements compared to what I save in price (9k). One would get improved sound quality due to the up-scaling chip, slightly better noise isolation, slightly more comfortable with the updated pads, play-pause music when headphone is worn-taken out, much improved mic (5 mic setup with ability to cancel cut some ambient sound) and finally support for multi-point connections (pair phone and laptop together and switch seamlessly).3. If I waited for XM4 prices to drop, rumors of XM5 with maybe a newer design will prompt one to wait even further. This is not going to end.So got these, tried them on for more than a week and here is what I think:1. If you don't need noise cancellation, then these aren't great value for the price. But if you need it, then you are looking at the one of the best. Cancels out most of the ambient sound (except voice - which you still can hear as muffled sounds - which can be masked by increasing volume a bit).2. Coming from wired headphones, these do feel heavy (these are one of the lightest noise cancelling headphones, so I wonder how comfortable the others are). But one does get used to it after a while.3. If you have never used a noise cancelling headphone in the past, ask around or visit a store to try this on. One may not like the feeling of wearing it, I for one didn't like it at all but then this is something you have to get used to when you are looking at noise cancellation. I think Bose is still more comfortable to wear.4. The bundled USB C cable is a jock. If you don't have a longer USB C cable, get one. You can use most chargers which lets you plug in a cable. Also comes with an airline adapter, good carrying case and an aux 3.5mm cable to use this wired (when battery is dead - without noise cancelling).5. Got a 1-2 months old import, made in Malaysia. So quite new, wonder why they were still making these (rumors of XM4 have been floating around for a long time, so I would have expected them to stop production).6. It supports lot of Codecs, so you don't have to worry about latency. But don't expect to game on this (connected to PC/PS4 via supplied cable), sounds quite weird with the bass rich sound profile (maybe I have to play with some setting to get it right).7. Sound quality is great for a Bluetooth headphone, but don't expect miracles if you have used decent wired or Bluetooth headphones. Much cheaper Bluetooth headphones can give you the same quality - but not coupled with similar noise isolation.8. The ear pads and padding in headband are comfortable. They are memory foam wrapped in synthetic leather. Downside is that they will get flaky after quite some time (even if you take good care of it, leave in a non-humid area). The manual has listed ear-pads as a replacement part available via authorized service center. I'm counting on that, if not, I'm sure parts will still be available from some part of the world since these sold quite well."

Sony service is the worst in the world. I have never come across such poor quality of service.",1.0,"The ProblemIt was about a few months ago that I started noticing a creaky noise from the right side of my WH-1000XM3 while listening to some audiobooks during a walk. At first, I ignored the noise as I thought it is due to my adjustments of the headband.I tried everything from removing my glasses to trying the tightest fit to get rid of the noise. To my disappointment, none of it worked.Visiting the service centre [4th July'20]I called in sony customer care who provided me with the phone no. of service centre near me. I reached out to ""iconnect"" in Gurgaon and tried describing my problem to him to which the response was that there is no need to explain to me the problem, just drive down to the service station. Surprised by the utter rudeness of attendant.I still followed the instructions and drove down to the service centre before 5 pm ( as I was instructed).I drove around 15 km to ""iconnect"" sony authorised service centre in Gurgaon. I patiently waited for my turn in an extremely warm service centre( The AC did not function). Interaction with the service centre employeeI started to describe the issue to an unengaged attendant who was still looking at his laptop screen.Me: I have been hearing squeaky noises from the right hinge of my headphones.He: ""Quiky"" without raising his head and continuing to look into his laptop.( As if the word was funny to him)Me: Excuse me!He: Yes, Sir.Me: The right side hinge makes noises even when the headphones are turned off. It is a workmanship defect.He: I haven't heard of such an issue ever.Me: But, it is an issue with my pair of headphones.He: We haven't been informed by Sony of any such issue.Meanwhile, my father started to record this interaction.To which the employee reacted aggressively that you can't record this. ( In an agitated tone)He said I won't serve you if you keep recording and left his counter.My father yielded and put his phone back into his pocket as we drove aa long way, the headphones were expensive and were going out of warranty in a few weeks.Finally, things moved forward, the service centre employee asked one of the technicians to look into the matter. We waited for another 40 mins. Meanwhile, the negative thoughts of getting my headphones messed up and with further damage crossed my mind as this place did not seem or operated professionally The Technician arrives with his analysis.The Technician: I have checked the circuitry and problem is not stemming from the electricals but is of mechanical in nature. I facepalmed myself and said to myself ""Exactly what I described, Why did you open my headphones""Next steps. The attendant spoke to a Sony employee and described him the problem over the phone & finally created a job sheet saying with the problem described as "" Abnormal noise from the right hinge even when the device is switched off""I asked him, what are the next steps, he said that he would let me know my Tuesday i.e 7th July'20 after he sends a video of this issue to the Sony Official. ( I am not too sure is the sound could be captured in a video effectively)Current status: I am patiently waiting for any update with the fear that I would be returned my old headphones which have now been open by not so professional service centre and might be prone to malfunction and since the warranty is near its end I might have to live with a product is further messed by the service centre.Update: 7th July 20The day I was promised that I would get to know what is the status of my service request.3 Sony call centre calls - Have committed me they have forwarded my concern to the service centre.5 calls to the service station- Either the some of the phones provided are always busy or out of service.I have no idea what is the status of my service request.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After calling the service centre for the 10th time they have finally replied that the headphones have been repaired and I can collect it. Which was informed to be non - repairable defect at the day of the first visit.The situation has gone bad to worse. Kindly help. I feel that I have been ripped off of my money by making this purchase decision. My request to SonyI have been a Sony customer & Fan for long, I remember our First coloured TV was a made in Japan Sony TV, which was a matter of pride for the entire family, Second was the iconic Walkman, then the flat screen Sony Wega ( I remember being mesmerised by picture quality I saw at the store), Sony Xperia U, Sony SRS-ZR7 and the latest WH-1000XM3.I believe the quality of service is the weakest link for Sony in India and this experience would deter me to move ahead or recommend Sony products to my friends and family with confidence. Kindly take this feedback and reflect on what kind of feelings do you want to invoke when a person hears the name ""Sony"". Should it invoke the feeling confidence & high quality that arises from its Japanese origins or the brand with terrible service?Buyer Beware."

Simply Astounding - Exceeds Expectations",5.0,"Prior to purchasing this product, I was a tad skeptical as I did not want to pay almost 30K for a pair of headphones.However, on further research and after reading many reviews, I decided to go for it, and after finally getting it, I am convinced that it's worth it. Let me tell you why...I purchased the silver one - purely for aesthetic reasons.. it looks great when compared to the black one, which in my opinion is just too plain. Truth be told, it is not exactly silver, more of a mixture between cream white and grey.The headphones are made out of a very good quality plastic, the inner structure is metal, and the headphone earcups are made of a very soft and comfortable leather.I would recommend wiping off any sweat or perspiration that accumulates on the leather earcups because pure leather starts flaking over time when exposed to moisture, but it's nothing to worry about too much.Comfort - 10/10 - There are many reviews which say that the fit is tight and that it makes the ears sweat. This is not entirely true, which these headphones have a slightly tighter fit as compared to the Bose QC 35s, it is not uncomfortable at all. I found it a lot more comfortable in comparison to many other headphones I have used in the past.It's slight tightness is for a very good reason  - to seal the sound in. If you take the Bose QC35s, they have a looser fit and are more comfortable, but the sound bleeds very badly, and is often embarrassing because it would disturb people sitting around you, this is not a problem with the Sonys as the sound would not bleed unless you use it at the highest volume and even then, just a little sound can be heard by others.The leather earcups are extremely comfortable as well on ear, and their quality is just plush and pristine.Noise Cancellation - 10/10 - The noise cancellation on these headphones are supposed to be the #1 industry standard out there, and this is justified, because after testing it out, it does block out almost 80% of all surrounding ambient noise.This is leagues ahead of the Bose QC35 noise cancellation. The Bose's noise cancellation has a cabin pressure like feel, it gets uncomfortable after a while and gives you a mild headache and sometimes makes your ears pop - just like when you're sitting in a plane, these Sony headphones on the other hand, block out the noise so effectively and efficiently that you don't feel a thing.Sound quality - 10/10 - I'm speechless when it comes to the sound quality on this, it is simply astounding. I absolutely love how Sony allows you to customise the sound - based on YOUR preference. In other words if I want to listen to a song with good bass, all I have to do is enable bass boost sound settings on the app and I can enjoy amazing, trembling bass. On the other hand if I want to listen to a more vocal pop song, I can change the setting on the app and be treated to an amazing vocal performance. This whoops the Bose QC35's a** as Bose does not have any equaliser to change the sound settings. Basically with Bose - what you hear is what you get.Battery Backup - 10/10 - I kid you not, I listened to music for close to an hour, and when I checked the battery, it said 100%, not even kidding, dead serious. It easily gives you 30 + hours (with NC active), and perhaps more than 35 without.Touch controls - 9/10 - the touch controls are really amazing as well, but they require patience to learn and will take you a while to get accustomed to their usage, once you get a hang of it, they are really nice.In the box - one pair of headphones, one 6 inch usb C charging cable WITHOUT adapter and one headphone jack.I would recommend downloading the Sony Headphone Connect app while setting up these headphones for best results.You can use it without the app as well, but you're missing out on amazing sound personalisation and customisation if you choose not to get it.My final verdict - if you can afford it, go for it. Highly recommended!"

Premium Sound. Next level Product",4.0,"When you listen to music, not many people understand the finer elements of a composition. SONY WH-1000XM3 surprises us and gives a new premium feeling for the ears. This is almost 3 month after purchase reviewPROS -Sony really stands out when it comes to XM series. Talking about this device, it gives great comfort to ears. The cushions are very soft. I can wear it for almost 2 hrs straight. I have even taken naps also wearing this so build quality is pretty awesome. It got dropped accidentally but still no damages at all. It doesn’t fall out during workouts. It’s water resistant but not water proof so don’t drop it in the pool. It fits all heads and super easy to carry as these are not heavy at all. The overhead has very soft cushion.The sound is more towards bass if you turn the volume to full. You can feel vibration sensation when you are listening to some punchy music which itself was great feeling for me.Coming to ANC, it’s the king as compared to the products at this price segment. It can almost cut down the traffic noise . There are 3 modes of noise cancellation that can be set from the app. It can also detect your motion and set the ANC levels according to it .NFC is a cool feature , works only with android. Battery is pretty decent. It last about 10 hrs with ANC on and almost 20hrs with it off. Charging is pretty quick but make sure you don’t charge it with a big charger than 20w (don’t use any Oneplus chargers or the bigger adapters) . It has a fast charge. 3 hrs is the full charge time.CONS-The headphones and the case both needs to be cleaned otherwise the black matte finish model gets dirty. Not that pleasing for treble music lovers. It doesn’t have auto play/pause, which should have been provided for this price.Overall, this is a worth buying product. If you are someone who wants to step up and enjoy music , this is the stepping stone. Although it’s successors have some updates but one should purchase this product while entering in ANC world."

My honest review of XM3s and parallel with bose",5.0,"I pre ordered this from Amazon on the 12th of October and received the product on 22nd after launch on 18th. Others from normal orders received it before me. Don't ever trust Amazon with pre-orders, no one there knows what pre order ACTUALLY MEANS.On 24TH OCT (2 days later) I noticed a weird noise kinda faint static on the right ear cup when the ANC turned ON. Returned the defective one and got the replacement on 26th October. A lot of others have reported this issue. This is defect is on few devices. Think of it as a minor annoyance. But even with the defect I was excited each time I used it.Keep in mind that this noise is so faint that you have turn off music to be able to notice. For me it was on the right ear cup, but people have reported this noise from either of ear cups.Apart from XM3, I have both Sony XM2, BOSE QC 35 II. Xm3 hands down the best in NC Performance. The sound quality is great, it's bass heavy (compared to the 2 above) so I like to listen to XM3 more than bose, which sounds flat and doesn't get you immersed. For context: I listen to heavy metal and rock music. The customizer in the app is awesome. Sony just sounds better than bose, maybe partly also because of hi-res audio, more HD  Codec support like LDAC,  SBC ETC.Mic and phone call performance on M3s is on par with bose. Bose is better. But XM2s were worst. I take calls from noisy environments like co work space, open parking are zone with wind gushing, in cabs in bus, etc others never complained one single time about my voice being inaudible.When you open the device it comes with 100 percentage battery charged. Sony is great, come XM2 AND BOSE, comes with 70 percent. One weird this is if app is not connect and registered it the devise says low battery even though it's fully charged.So I typically use bose when I work at office as daily driver (as it also has multi device connectivity).M3s have come a long way on comfort, and now the only con with xm3 is that my ear sweats a lot, this doesn't happen with Bose quietcomfort. I like the love the gesture controls on M3 more than button on bose. I wish there was way to lock down touch to limit unintended touch triggers.Wrt to battery life is AWESOME. One really can't ask for more. There is no standby battery discharge, my observation over 5 days of no activity. The auto off does not work because any one device is always connected.On the build quality, I like bose better. Honestly, this is the only area I like bose better.Closing thoughts, Bose is my daily driver because it allows me to connect with Mac and phone same time. I can swap and connect calls easily. Also the sound signature isn't immersive, allows me to work even when the music is on. XM3s for me are the special ones, I use them for the special 'me' time. When I am looking to just enjoy music.PS. I am a developer / maker of Story Stream a platform to publish and stream immersive audio stories narrated by RJs and Voice artists. Story stream is live on Alex and coming soon on Google assistant devices. I use these headpphones for testing my apps ;) (if you have Alexa, you can enable Story Stream from the store)And that's the only reason why I have 3 expensive headphones. If I had to pick one, it's will be XM3 in a heart beat, even though it a good 15days old now, I get excited everytime I pick it up from the case to wear! Even though the bose is newer, I don't get as excited.If you have the budget, go for it. I can guarantee that you will be very excited about using it each time you put it on. This comes from some one who got a defective product, I swear even with the defective piece I was so excited about using it each time till the replacement arrived. Honestly Sony has done a tremendous job on XM3."
